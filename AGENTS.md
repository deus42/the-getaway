# Agent Operating Guide

This guide defines how Codex agents work inside **The Getaway** repository. Follow it end-to-end before writing code.

## 1. Quick Reference
- Root app: `the-getaway/` (Vite + React + TypeScript).
- Source folders: `src/components`, `src/game`, `src/store`, `src/__tests__`, `src/assets`, `public/`.
- Primary scripts (run from `the-getaway/`): `yarn dev`, `yarn build`, `yarn preview`, `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, `yarn test:watch`.
- Use Yarn for all package scripts and installs.

## 2. Pre-Task Checklist (Mandatory)
1. **Check Linear first**  
   - Open the **MVP** (and **PostMVP** when relevant) Linear projects.  
   - Identify the next `Todo` issue you are assigned to or that matches the roadmap order.  
   - If the target roadmap step lacks a Linear issue, create one immediately under the MVP project before coding.
2. **Confirm task scope**  
   - Read the Linear issue, `memory-bank/mvp-plan.md`, and related memory bank docs (`game-design.md`, `architecture.md`, `plot.md`).  
   - Note prerequisites, validation steps, and documentation requirements.
3. **Update Linear status**  
   - Move the issue to `In Progress` only when you start implementation.  
   - Keep status synchronized; revert to `Todo` if you stop work without finishing.

Do not begin coding until this checklist is complete.

## 3. Implementation Workflow
- **During development**
  - Keep changes focused on the active Linear issue. Ignore unrelated modified files; never revert user-authored work.
  - Prefer incremental commits; use imperative commit messages (Conventional Commits welcome).
  - Follow TypeScript, React, and Redux best practices; avoid default exports for shared utilities.
- **Testing**
  - Match validation steps from the roadmap and Linear ticket.  
  - Default commands: `yarn lint`, targeted `yarn test` runs, or full suites when coverage is expected.  
  - Record executed commands in PR summaries, progress logs, or issue comments.
- **Documentation updates**
  - Update `memory-bank/architecture.md` whenever architectural patterns, game systems, or data flow change.  
  - Update `memory-bank/game-design.md` for gameplay rules, balance numbers, or narrative WHAT decisions.  
  - After finishing a roadmap step, log it in `memory-bank/progress.md` using the XML structure.  
  - Mirror scope changes in `memory-bank/mvp-plan.md` only when the plan itself evolves (never mark completion there).
- **Linear sync**
  - When work completes, add a comment to the Linear issue summarizing tasks performed, validation, and key code references.  
  - Move the issue to `Done` immediately after the implementation, docs, and validation are complete.

## 4. Coding Standards
- TypeScript throughout; add explicit types on exported/public APIs.
- Indentation: 2 spaces, single quotes, trailing semicolons.
- React components use PascalCase files; functions, variables, slices use camelCase.
- Keep code self-explanatory; add brief comments only when complex logic needs framing.
- Prefer `apply_patch` for manual edits; avoid using it for generated files.

## 5. Testing & Validation Expectations
- Jest + React Testing Library (`ts-jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`).
- Tests live in `src/__tests__/` with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` suffixes.
- Setup file: `src/setupTests.ts` (includes `@testing-library/jest-dom`).
- Aim to cover reducers, selectors, and core game logic. Optional coverage via `yarn test --coverage`.
- Document exact commands executed when reporting validation results.

## 6. Memory Bank Discipline
- **Design vs. Architecture**  
  - `game-design.md` = game mechanics, balance, player experience (WHAT).  
  - `architecture.md` = code patterns, modules, data flow (HOW).  
  - Never mix the two; sync both whenever implementation deviates from plan.
- **Progress tracking**  
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` records completed steps only (with XML tags).  
  - `memory-bank/mvp-plan.md` lists scope; edit only to change requirements or ordering.
- **Narrative work**  
  - When adding or editing dialogue/quests, align tone with `memory-bank/plot.md` and cite the referenced section in change summaries.

## 7. Commit & PR Guidelines
- Use imperative messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc. acceptable).  
- PRs must include: summary + rationale, linked issues (e.g., `Closes #123`), screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, tests executed, and note any breaking changes.
- Never commit secrets; keep runtime config in `.env.local` with `VITE_` prefixes.
- Place large/optimized assets in `public/`.

## 8. Handoff Requirements
- Before requesting review or merging: confirm implementation, docs, tests, and Linear status are all updated.  
- Provide logical next steps (tests to rerun, smoke checks) when delivering work.  
- If unexpected repo changes appear, pause and ask the user how to proceedâ€”do not revert unowned work.

Adhering to this guide keeps roadmap docs, Linear, and the codebase in sync. Follow it strictly for every task.
