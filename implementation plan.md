   - Integrate story arcs, branching dialogues, and mission/quest architecture.

4. **Alpha Testing & Iteration**  
   - Conduct internal playtesting to identify gameplay or narrative issues.  
   - Collect user feedback from a small group of testers, refine features, and polish mechanics.

5. **Beta Launch & Polishing**  
   - Open the game to a broader audience for more feedback.  
   - Refine balance, fix bugs, optimize performance, and deepen content.

6. **Marketing & Community Building**  
   - Create social media presence, developer diaries, and teasers.  
   - Build or expand a community (Discord, subreddit, etc.) for direct user interaction.

7. **Official Launch**  
   - Deploy the final version, ensuring smooth distribution (website, PWA, or distribution platform).  
   - Ensure support channels for bug reports, community feedback, and ongoing content updates.

8. **Post-Launch Support & Expansion**  
   - Provide regular patches to fix issues and maintain player engagement.  
   - Develop expansions or new story arcs based on community reception.

## **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan**

### **Phase 1: Concept & Story Finalization**

1. **Narrative World-Building**  
   - Refine the dictator’s background, the protagonist’s journey, and major factions (e.g., NARC).  
   - Outline each story arc (Miami Underground, Road to the North, Espionage & Infiltration, Final Showdown).

2. **Game Design Document (GDD)**  
   - Write a formal design doc including gameplay loops, combat mechanics, progression systems, etc.  
   - Outline art style, UI mockups, sound/music direction, and the general “feel” of the game.

3. **Scoping & Feasibility**  
   - Determine feature priority (must-have vs. nice-to-have).  
   - Estimate time and resources needed (team roles, budget, timelines).

---

### **Phase 2: Technical Foundation & Prototyping**

1. **Tech Stack Decision**  
   - Choose a rendering library (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS, or Three.js) or game framework for the browser.  
   - Pick a front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte) for the UI (menus, inventories, dialogs).  
   - Decide on server technology if needed (Node.js, Python, or serverless for single-player).

2. **Prototype Core Mechanics**  
   - **Basic Movement & Turn System**: Implement grid-based or hex-based movement.  
   - **Combat Prototype**: Create a simple turn-based battle with placeholder units or tokens.  
   - **Dialogue/Quest Skeleton**: Set up a basic branching dialogue tree or quest system to test narrative flow.

3. **Preliminary Art & UI Mockups**  
   - Use placeholder sprites/assets for characters, environments, and UI elements.  
   - Design key UI components (e.g., health/AP bars, inventory panels, dialogue boxes).

4. **Testing Prototype**  
   - Gather early feedback from team members or a small circle of testers.  
   - Validate whether the turn-based combat is fun and whether the narrative is compelling in its basic form.

### **Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation**

1. **Refine Combat & Strategy**  
   - Add advanced features (cover mechanics, flanking bonuses, special abilities, or combos).  
   - Integrate skill checks or perk-based moves reminiscent of classic Fallout/Heroes mechanics.

2. **Dialogue & Quest System**  
   - Implement branching paths, quest tracking, and dynamic NPC interactions.  
   - Allow moral choices and skill checks (e.g., hacking, persuasion) that affect outcomes.

3. **Progression & Customization**  
   - Design character leveling or perk systems.  
   - Introduce item or equipment mechanics (weapons, gear, resources).

4. **World Building**  
   - Flesh out major locations (Miami, midlands, capital city, etc.).  
   - Create NPC rosters with unique personalities, backgrounds, and side quests.

5. **UI & UX Polish**  
   - Refine in-game menus, inventory management, skill trees, and quest logs for clarity and usability.  
   - Maintain consistent visuals that reflect the game’s post-collapse or totalitarian theme.

### **Phase 4: Alpha Testing & Feedback Loop**

1. **Internal Playtesting**  
   - Conduct daily or weekly test sessions to spot gameplay imbalances, narrative gaps, or UI friction.  
   - Document bugs and improvements; prioritize fixes and refinements in sprints.

2. **Closed Alpha Release**  
   - Invite a limited group of external testers (trusted fans, friends, or community members).  
   - Collect structured feedback through surveys, direct contact (Discord, forums), or user analytics.

3. **Iteration & Refinement**  
   - Address top-priority issues such as game-breaking bugs, unclear mechanics, pacing problems.  
   - Adjust difficulty progression, quest flow, or storyline pacing based on player feedback.

4. **Performance & Optimization**  
   - Ensure stable frame rates and quick load times on various browsers and devices.  
   - Optimize memory usage and reduce network overhead, if an online component exists.

### **Phase 5: Beta Launch & Final Polish**

1. **Open Beta**  
   - Expand the tester pool to a broader audience for more comprehensive playtesting.  
   - Monitor server load and user feedback channels for any immediate issues.

2. **Balancing & Fine-Tuning**  
   - Tweak combat difficulty, economy, and progression rates.  
   - Patch remaining quest logic errors or branching narrative inconsistencies.

3. **Marketing Ramp-Up**  
   - Release teasers, developer diaries, and social media updates.  
   - Encourage community engagement to build anticipation and collect additional insights.

4. **Localization & Accessibility** *(Optional but recommended)*  
   - Add language support if targeting international audiences.  
   - Implement accessibility features such as colorblind mode, text scaling, and subtitle settings.

### **Phase 6: Official Launch**

1. **Final Build**  
   - Lock content for release; finalize art, story arcs, UI, and features.  
   - Conduct a last round of QA tests to catch critical bugs or performance issues.

2. **Distribution**  
   - Publish the game to your official website or distribution platforms (e.g., itch.io, PWA).  
   - Provide clear instructions (minimum system/browser requirements, disclaimers).

3. **Launch-Day Community Management**  
   - Have moderators on standby in community channels (Discord, Reddit, Steam forums if applicable).  
   - Quickly address major issues and deploy hotfixes if critical bugs appear.

---

### **Phase 7: Post-Launch Support & Expansion**

1. **Patching & Updates**  
   - Fix emergent issues reported by the post-launch player base.  
   - Make balance changes based on large-scale player data (win/loss rates, quest completion stats).

2. **Community Engagement**  
   - Keep players informed about upcoming patches, expansions, or events.  
   - Consider developer Q&A sessions, behind-the-scenes content, or community polls to shape future updates.

3. **Long-Term Roadmap**  
   - Plan expansions or DLC: new story arcs, additional playable characters, fresh missions.  
   - Explore optional monetization (e.g., cosmetic items) without compromising core gameplay.
