# Plot Bible

## Plot Bible

## Setting snapshot (2036) — United States
- **Climate:** Subtropical storms hammer the Atlantic coast; seawalls and pumps fail weekly.
- **Government:** Chancellor Victor Harrow rules through the Emergent Security Directorate (ESD), a fusion of privatized police, militias, and corporate intelligence.
- **Economy:** Ration tokens, black-market scrip, and corporate credit chips circulate simultaneously while critical infrastructure is auctioned to loyal oligarchs.
- **Technology:** Drones, predictive policing, and biometric checkpoints contain cities; resistance cells rely on repurposed industrial tech and analog dead drops.
- **Alliances:** The North Atlantic Resistance Coalition (NARC)—Canada, EU remnants, and sympathetic Latin American states—funds covert cells but avoids overt intervention.

## Core conflict — Operation Cold Iron
Harrow’s regime prepares a lightning strike into Canada to seize hydroelectric power and rare earth reserves. Player decisions determine whether the invasion collapses and whether Harrow’s war crimes become public.

## Narrative pillars
- **Occupation as Everyday Reality:** Every mission should remind players that the regime polices food, information, and movement; small victories like lifting curfew in one district matter as much as grand strikes.
- **Trust is Currency:** Alliances remain fragile. Reputation systems, dialogue checks, and companion loyalty must reflect whom the player chooses to protect.
- **Tech vs. Ingenuity:** High-end regime technology collides with hacked-together resistance tools. Systems should reward traps, misdirection, and social engineering over brute force.
- **Consequences Echo:** Choices reverberate across acts (e.g., sparing a syndicate broker unlocks Act III smuggling assistance; leaking intel early hardens ESD patrols in Act IV).

## Power factions

### Emergent Security Directorate (ESD)
- **Description:** Data-obsessed enforcers clad in graphite armor and mirrored visors.
- **Internal Rift:** Traditionalist commanders clash with profit-driven corporate officers, producing exploitable fractures.

### North Atlantic Resistance Coalition (NARC)
- **Description:** Provides intel, tech smuggling routes, and extraction contacts.
- **Strategy:** Prefers long-term destabilization over open war.

### Miami Cell “Shelterline”
- **Description:** Grassroots network led by Amara Velez, focused on disrupting port logistics and covert evacuations.

### Scavenger Syndicates
- **Description:** Crews like the Dockside Brokers trade ration chips, weapon mods, and intel; loyalty shifts with respect earned.

### Eisenclave Conglomerate
- **Description:** Corporate collaborator profiting from surveillance contracts and privatized utilities while supplying Harrow with drone swarms and AI analysis.

## Protagonist
- **Callsign:** Trace (customizable)

### Background threads
- **Former Courier:** Knows smuggling tunnels and excels at stealth objectives.
- **Disgraced Cadet:** Retains knowledge of ESD protocols and gains unique dialogue with loyalists.
- **Street Medic:** Unlocks pacifist options and leverage over refugee factions.
- **Personal Stakes:** Trace’s father vanished during the Battle of Miami; rumors suggest he survived as an ESD detainee transferred north with Operation Cold Iron.

## Narrative structure

### Act 1 — Ashes of Miami
- Break curfew to retrieve contraband medkits.
- Meet Shelterline at an abandoned metro hub and disable drone beacons to prove loyalty.
- Uncover evidence that Harrow’s forces funnel munitions north via cargo rail.

### Act 2 — Fault Lines
- **Location:** Mid-Atlantic Corridor
- Travel alongside refugee caravans and damaged highways; choices impact faction reputation.
- Infiltrate Eisenclave data centers to expose Operation Cold Iron logistics.
- Secure NARC extraction while witnessing ideological infighting.

### Act 3 — Glass Capital
- **Location:** New Columbia (former Washington, D.C.)
- Penetrate a walled corporate arcology.
- Collaborate with double agent Commander Sadiq Rahm to sow distrust inside ESD ranks.
- Choose between leaking intel publicly or preserving leverage for NARC.

### Act 4 — Northern Breakpoint
- Sabotage invasion staging yards hidden beneath Great Lakes freight tunnels.
- Trigger a citywide blackout or hijack the drone swarm; branching outcome shifts finale tone.
- Confront Harrow aboard an airborne command platform; expose crimes, topple the regime, or negotiate a ceasefire.

### Interludes
- Between acts, Theo “Circuit” broadcasts shortwave summaries that branch based on player reputation.
- Persistent menu tab tracks civilians saved, lost, or displaced; values influence NARC asset deployment in later acts.
- Mid-campaign propaganda speech adapts to player disruptions and unlocks custom finale dialogue hooks.

## Alternate Outcomes
- **Outcome:** High NARC trust unlocks an Act IV airlift with reduced reinforcements; low trust forces a hazardous ground extraction.
- **Outcome:** Shelterline morale reflects civilian-centric choices. If morale collapses, Amara considers abandoning Miami, altering companion availability.
- **Outcome:** Prioritizing intel over spectacle opens a ceasefire ending—buying time yet leaving the regime wounded rather than toppled.

## Supporting Cast
- **Character:** Direct and dry-humored; prioritizes civilian safety.
- **Character:** Teen hacker delivering pirate radio bulletins; balances levity and exposition.
- **Character:** Decorated officer with family defected to Canada; speech oscillates between clipped jargon and restrained grief.
- **Character:** Coordinates aid drops with measured, urgent diplomacy.

## Tone And Dialogue
- **Voice:** Grounded optimism under exhaustion; uses coded phrases such as “streetlight” for safe house and “quiet tide” for curfew lift.
- **Voice:** Precise and ominous, referencing protocols and statistics. Intimidation stems from controlled calm.
- **Voice:** Survival-first with dark humor and wary glances; frequently address the player by nickname.
- **Voice:** Propaganda layered with glitch interference, blending authoritarian slogans with upbeat corporate sound bites.

## Dialogue Examples
- **Example:** Streetlight’s back on. You’ve got seven minutes before the floodlights sweep—move like you still trust your knees.
- **Example:** Citizen Trace. Compliance Directive 19-B authorizes lethal countermeasures. Present for scan or be marked subversive.
- **Example:** You bring fuel? Then we talk. No fuel, no favors—curfew makes saints of none of us.
- **Example:** Harrow’s Dawn—Order, Prosperity, Destiny. Stay inside. Stay loyal. Stay alive.

## Formatting Cheatsheet
- **Rule:** Use em dashes for interruptions during tense stealth moments (“Hold—drone!”).
- **Rule:** Reserve ellipses for trauma or exhaustion, not casual hesitation.
- **Rule:** Mark code phrases with italics in scripts (_quiet tide_).
- **Rule:** Keep broadcast slogans in uppercase to contrast with human dialogue (“HAIL HARROW. HAIL ORDER.”).

## Writing Guidelines
- **Influence:** Lean on dream-like imagery and symbolic juxtapositions; treat pathos as eccentricity, letting wonder bloom even in ruins.
- **Influence:** Favor short, plain sentences with sardonic edge; use wit to expose absurd bureaucracy while keeping moral stakes clear.
- **Influence:** Balance intimate banter with wartime horror, letting humor mask fear and deferred dreams reappear as motifs.
- **Guideline:** Blend bleakness with wit—humor should feel like survival instinct, not slapstick.
- **Guideline:** Introduce surreal or absurd details (drones as coyotes, neon farms in flooded malls) to underline occupied America’s strangeness.
- **Guideline:** Write in short, rhythmic sentences; keep the tone conversational and avoid unnecessary jargon.
- **Guideline:** Satirize regime propaganda and corporate greed through dry irony; let laughter reclaim humanity.
- **Guideline:** Reveal moral weight through player choices and dialogue consequences rather than overt preaching.
- **Guideline:** Deploy pop-culture or meta-references sparingly; ensure each deepens character or stakes.
- **Guideline:** Counter cynicism with flashes of innocence—cheap pizza, zoo trips under sirens, feeding llamas during raids.
- **Guideline:** Experiment with interludes, radio monologues, and fragmented memories to convey the war’s chaos.
- **Guideline:** Give every faction and character distinct idioms; weave in Ukrainian slang or mixed languages to ground authenticity.

## Themes And Motifs
- **Theme:** Makeshift solar arrays, graffiti maps, and coded lullabies indicate culture surviving occupation.
- **Theme:** Museums repurposed as bunkers; characters fight for memory alongside freedom.
- **Theme:** Missions force trade-offs between protecting civilians, gathering intel, or striking the regime; outcomes affect future support.

## Quest Hooks
- **Quest:** Rescue climate refugees stranded on a seized cruise liner; ration limited ferry space.
- **Quest:** Recover art and archives hidden beneath Miami Stadium; choose between public release or black-market leverage.
- **Quest:** Disable a satellite uplink relay; success unlocks covert NARC drops, failure strengthens enemy patrol AI.
- **Quest:** Investigate ration fraud implicating a sympathetic ESD quartermaster and decide whether to expose or shield them.

## Relationship Web
- **Link:** Mentor-protégé arc evolving from guarded professionalism to mutual reliance.
- **Link:** Younger-sibling energy enabling lighter banter and tech exposition.
- **Link:** Fragile alliance emphasizing strategic debate and betrayal risk.
- **Link:** Philosophical tension between frontline urgency and geopolitical calculus.

## Visual Audio Motifs

- **Motif:** Flooded storefronts become hydroponic farms, murals memorialize the missing, ration lines stretch past corporate billboards.

## Future Expansion Seeds
- **Seed:** Chemical weapon stockpiles leak in the Midwest after Harrow falls, aligning with post-MVP roadmap Step 31.
- **Seed:** Motorcycle network connects Shelterline safe routes, supporting Step 27.1 content.
- **Seed:** Hunger and thirst mechanics mirror refugee supply chains, reinforcing Step 28.1 systems.

## Implementation Notes
- **Note:** Mirror each narrative beat with an in-game system hook so morale, reputation, and intel choices surface in UI.
- **Note:** When scripting dialogue, annotate each cue with faction, emotional intent, and gameplay impact.
- **Note:** Maintain a rolling changelog appended to this file whenever major plot revisions occur to keep the memory bank auditable.
- **Usage:** Use this plot bible to align missions, cinematics, and dialogue. New narrative beats must reinforce Operation Cold Iron, escalate faction stakes, or deepen the player’s connection to dismantling Harrow’s regime.
