# Narrative Alignment

Narrative Alignment & Tone Reference

All quest text, dialogue, ambient barks, and narrative UI copy must align with the plot bible in [[03 Lore/Plot Bible]].
	•	Consult [[03 Lore/Plot Bible#Tone And Dialogue|Tone and Dialogue]] + [[03 Lore/Plot Bible#Writing Guidelines|Writing Guidelines]] before drafting new lines or localizations.
	•	Use [[03 Lore/Plot Bible#Narrative structure|Narrative structure]] + the Narrative pillars to anchor quest stakes and branching logic.
	•	Document in change logs which plot bible sections guided the update (e.g., Guideline 4 for satire, Relationship web for character dynamics) so future passes can trace intent.
	•	When localizing, preserve surreal juxtapositions, dark humor, and moral nuance outlined in the plot bible; adjust idioms without losing the tone set by the English originals.

Designers should treat the plot bible as the authoritative “what” for story cadence, while this game design file captures the “how” those tonal requirements manifest in gameplay systems and quest structure.
