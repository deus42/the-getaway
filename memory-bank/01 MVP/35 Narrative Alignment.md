Narrative Alignment & Tone Reference

All quest text, dialogue, ambient barks, and narrative UI copy must align with the plot bible’s XML directives in `memory-bank/03 Lore/Plot Bible.md`.
	•	Consult `<tone_and_dialogue>` for faction voice, dialogue formatting, and the `<writing_guidelines>` list before drafting new lines or localizations.
	•	Use the narrative pillars and alternate outcomes described under `<narrative_structure>` to anchor quest stakes and branching logic.
	•	Document in change logs which plot bible sections guided the update (e.g., Guideline 4 for satire, Relationship web for character dynamics) so future passes can trace intent.
	•	When localizing, preserve surreal juxtapositions, dark humor, and moral nuance outlined in the plot bible; adjust idioms without losing the tone set by the English originals.

Designers should treat the plot bible as the authoritative “what” for story cadence, while this game design file captures the “how” those tonal requirements manifest in gameplay systems and quest structure.
