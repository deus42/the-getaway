Setting & Worldbuilding

Dystopian City Setting

The game takes place in a sprawling dystopian metropolis in the near-future. The city is in decline, characterized by crumbling infrastructure and high-tech enclaves existing side by side. Society has fractured into rival factions controlling different districts, from lawless slums to fortified corporate zones. The atmosphere is gritty and oppressive, with neon-lit streets, polluted air, and constant tension in the environment.

Distinct Zones & Biomes

The city is divided into several zones, each acting as a distinct "biome" with its own environment, hazards, and gameplay impacts:
	•	Industrial Wasteland: Abandoned factories and toxic refineries dominate this area. Visibility is low due to smog, and lingering pollution can harm characters over time. Players might need gas masks or special gear to explore safely.
	•	Downtown Core: A corporate-controlled high-rise district filled with advanced technology and heavy security. Expect surveillance cameras, security drones, and automated turrets. Stealth or hacking skills are valuable here to bypass high-tech defenses.
	•	Slums and Undercity: Dense shantytowns and underground tunnels controlled by gangs. The cramped, maze-like environment provides plenty of cover for ambushes. Resources are scarce but scavenging can yield useful items. Danger is high, but so are opportunities for those who know the back alleys.
	•	Outskirts (Deadlands): The crumbling city edges that blend into a wasteland. Fewer people live here, but environmental dangers are greater (pockets of radiation, wild creatures, unstable ruins). The outskirts often serve as risky travel routes between city sectors and hide secret caches or wandering nomads.

Each zone offers unique resources, enemies, and quests. Transitioning between zones may require planning and equipment adjustments, reinforcing the feeling of entering a different world or biome within the city.
