# Inventory (MVP)

## Balance values (equipment)

Equipment & Inventory (MVP scope)

**Status:** ✅ MVP scope. MVP includes inventory + quest pickups + a small consumable set; deep economy/micromanagement lives in [[02 Post-MVP/equipment-inventory]].

MVP intent:
	•	Keep inventory friction low in Level 0.
	•	Support quest pickups + a small set of consumables (HP heal, paranoia relief).
	•	Avoid ammo micromanagement, contraband tiers, vendor refresh simulation, and deep encumbrance penalties in MVP.
	•	If any carry limit exists, make it generous and non-punishing.
