# George (AI Companion)

AI Assistant & Player Guidance

AI Companion

An omnipresent AI assistant ("George") accompanies the player from the start. George exists as an overlay in the Level-0 Objectives area of the HUD and serves several key functions:
	•	**Mission Guidance & Tutorials:** George calls attention to the player’s current objectives, suggests next steps, and explains new mechanics when they first appear. It proactively surfaces optional side quests or dynamic events if they align with the player’s goals. Players can ask George “What should I do?” to receive contextual hints without spoiling surprises.
	•	**Personality & Humor:** George has a distinct personality that evolves to mirror the player’s choices. If the player often uses sarcastic dialogue options, George develops a dry wit; if the player is earnest and compassionate, George’s tone becomes encouraging. The assistant cracks jokes and makes sardonic observations about the dystopian world, adding levity to exploration.
	•	**Adaptive Relationship:** George comments on the player’s karma, faction alignment, and recent actions. Positive or negative karma shifts George’s respect level and the tenor of its banter. It may admonish ruthless play or cheer moral decisions. Faction reputations can affect George’s advice (e.g., warning when entering hostile territory).
	•	**Conversation Interface:** Players can initiate short conversations with George using dialogue options similar to NPC interactions (e.g., ask for a hint, vent frustration, or debate philosophy). While George cannot act physically in the world, its responses enrich narrative immersion.
	•	**Diegetic Implementation:** George is diegetic: an AI chip implanted in the protagonist’s device. This lets it integrate into the world’s tech-noir aesthetic while justifying its narrative commentary. Upgrades or bugs to George can form the basis of quests.

George’s dialogue adheres to the tonal guidelines in the plot bible: darkly funny, surreal, and morally nuanced. Designers should log references to relevant plot bible directives (e.g., Tone Guideline 4 for satire) when writing George’s lines to ensure consistency.
