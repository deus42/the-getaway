# Character & Progression

<mechanic name="character_creation">
Character Creation & Progression (MVP scope)

<implementation_status>✅ MVP scope. MVP supports a real character build (background + starting attributes, and enough progression to matter in Level 0). Deep perk economies / large trees live in `memory-bank/02 Post-MVP/progression-advanced.md`.</implementation_status>

MVP intent:
	•	Character creation sets: portrait/appearance (lightweight), background, and starting SPECIAL/attributes.
	•	Progression can be shallow in Level 0: enough to support checks (dialogue/stealth/hacking) without a huge perk economy.
