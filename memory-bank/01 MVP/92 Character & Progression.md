# Character & Progression

Character Creation & Progression (MVP scope)

**Status:** ✅ MVP scope. MVP supports a real character build (background + starting attributes, and enough progression to matter in Level 0). Deep perk economies / large trees live in [[02 Post-MVP/progression-advanced]].

MVP intent:
	•	Character creation sets: portrait/appearance (lightweight), background, and starting SPECIAL/attributes.
	•	Progression can be shallow in Level 0: enough to support checks (dialogue/stealth/hacking) without a huge perk economy.
