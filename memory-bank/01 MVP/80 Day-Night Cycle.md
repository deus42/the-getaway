# Day-Night Cycle

Day-Night Cycle Effects

The 24-hour day-night cycle is not just cosmetic; it has significant gameplay implications:
	•	Lighting and Visibility: During the day, visibility is better for both the player and NPCs. At night, darkness can be an ally for stealth but a hazard for awareness. Players can use light sources (flashlights, headlights on vehicles, flares) to see, but these can give away their position. Conversely, darkness can allow a stealthy player to bypass enemies or perform silent takedowns more easily. We might implement a visibility meter that is affected by light level – in a pitch-black alley at midnight, enemies might not detect the player until they are very close (unless the enemy has night-vision gear).
	•	NPC Schedules & Availability: As mentioned, many NPC behaviors depend on time of day. Some quests explicitly require a certain time (e.g., “Meet the informant at 2 AM behind the bar” or “Patrol the perimeter at dawn”). If the player misses the time window, they may have to wait another day or find an alternate solution. Shops typically operate during daylight hours; at night you might have to rely on vending machines or black market dealers. Certain characters (like a vigilante who prowls at night, or a radio DJ who broadcasts only after midnight) are only accessible at specific times.
	•	Difficulty and Encounters: Generally, nights are more dangerous in the city’s rough areas. More predators and criminals come out after dark, and some supernatural or unusual events might only happen at night if the setting permits. However, night can also reduce the number of patrolling guards in heavily controlled areas (guards need sleep too), making infiltration easier. In contrast, daytime might be safer for travel in some places but could expose the player to snipers or long-range threats in open areas since visibility is high. The player should plan missions taking time into account – for example, maybe they want to attack a gang hideout at noon when many members are asleep after their night activities.
	•	Curfew and Law Enforcement: Curfew is enforced from 22:00 to 06:00 in the world clock. If caught out during curfew, the player can be confronted or attacked by security forces on sight, adding another layer of strategy (do you risk traveling through a curfew window or wait until morning?).
	•	Rest and Recovery: Night is a logical time for the player to rest their character (recovering fatigue as per survival mechanics). If the player has a safe place to sleep, they might choose to spend the night there and venture out in daytime. However, there could be incentives to stay awake – certain missions or crimes are best done under cover of darkness.
	•	Atmosphere and Visuals: The city’s look and feel changes with time. At night, neon signs flicker to life, streets are quieter in some districts and louder in others (club districts, gang territories). During early morning, fog or smog might hang over lower areas, and you might see people commuting or cleaning up after the previous night’s chaos. These touches make the world more immersive.
	•	HUD Readout: The top-right HUD now shows a compact 24-hour digital command clock (`HH:MM`) only. It uses a stable style surface with no phase iconography or progress bar; travel advisories and hazard cues remain exclusive to George’s rolling feed and history log.

The day-night cycle encourages players to think about when they do things, not just how. It adds a rhythm to gameplay – perhaps a cycle of planning in safe areas by day and executing risky moves at night, or vice versa depending on the player's approach.
