# The Getaway - Architecture Documentation

## Project Structure

The Getaway is structured as a modern React application with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server. The architecture follows a modular design approach, separating game logic from UI components and state management.

### Project Layout

The project is organized as follows:

- `/memory-bank` - Documentation and design files (outside the actual game code)
- `/the-getaway` - The main game project folder
  - `/src` - Source code for the game
  - Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### Core Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the project for type safety and better development experience.
- **React**: Provides the UI layer and component architecture.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **Phaser**: Game engine for rendering and game mechanics.

- Audio (sound effects, music)
- Other media files

### `/the-getaway/src/components`

React components that make up the game's user interface:
- **`GameCanvas.tsx`**: The main component that integrates Phaser with React. It initializes the Phaser game instance and provides the canvas where the game is rendered.

### `/the-getaway/src/components/ui`

Dedicated folder for reusable React UI components, separate from core game logic/controllers.

- **`PlayerStatusPanel.tsx`**: Displays player health, action points, and potentially other stats using data from the Redux `playerSlice`.
- **`LogPanel.tsx`**: Displays a scrolling list of game events and messages, reading data from the Redux `logSlice`.

### `/the-getaway/src/game`

Contains all game logic, separated into modules:

#### `/the-getaway/src/game/combat`

Handles the turn-based combat system:

- **`combatSystem.ts`**: Core combat mechanics including:
  - Damage calculations with hit chance modifiers
  - Distance and range calculations for targeting
  - Action Point (AP) costs for different actions

#### `/the-getaway/src/game/scenes`

Contains Phaser Scene classes.

- **`BootScene.ts`**: A preliminary Phaser scene that runs first. Its primary role is to read the initial game state (map, player position) from the Redux store and then start the `MainScene`, passing the necessary data via the scene's `init` method. This ensures `MainScene` has the data it needs before its `create` method runs.
- **`MainScene.ts`**: The main Phaser scene responsible for rendering the game world (map tiles, player sprite, enemy sprites, health bars). It subscribes to the Redux store (`worldSlice`, `playerSlice`) and updates the visual representation based on state changes received via its `handleStateChange` method. It also handles the creation, update, and removal of Phaser game objects representing entities.

### `/the-getaway/src/store`

Redux state management:

  - Active and completed quests
  - Quest objectives and progress
  - Dialogue tracking and history
  - Active dialogue state for UI rendering

- **`logSlice.ts`**: Manages a list of log messages for display in the UI. Provides an `addLogMessage` action to push new messages (e.g., combat events, warnings) onto the log stack.

### `/the-getaway/src/styles`

CSS and styling resources:
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Custom CSS styles
- Theme definitions

## Key Components

### GameCanvas Component

`GameCanvas.tsx` is the bridge between React and Phaser. It:
1. Creates a container div for the Phaser canvas
2. Initializes a Phaser game instance when the component mounts
3. Configures Phaser with appropriate settings
4. Handles cleanup on component unmount
5. Provides an interface for React components to interact with the Phaser game

### Redux Store

The Redux store serves as the central state management system, with:
- Separate slices for different game aspects
- Actions and reducers for state updates
- Selectors for efficient state access

## Data Flow

1. User interactions (keyboard, mouse) are captured by React or directly by Phaser
2. Game logic in the `/src/game` modules processes these inputs
3. State changes are dispatched to the Redux store
4. UI components react to state changes and update accordingly
5. The game rendering is handled by Phaser through the GameCanvas component

## Implementation Patterns

The codebase follows several consistent patterns:

### Immutability

All state updates are performed immutably using object spreads and function returns rather than direct mutation. This enables:
- Predictable state management
- Easy undo/redo functionality in the future
- Better performance through reference equality checks

Example from `combat/combatSystem.ts`:
```typescript
// Execute a move
export const executeMove = (
  entity: Player | Enemy,
  targetPosition: Position
): Player | Enemy => {
  // Update position and AP without mutation
  return {
    ...entity,
    position: targetPosition,
    actionPoints: entity.actionPoints - DEFAULT_MOVEMENT_COST
  };
};
```

### Type Safety

Strong typing is used throughout the codebase to prevent runtime errors and provide better developer experience:
- All function parameters and return types are explicitly typed
- Unions and intersections are used to model complex relationships
- Generic types are employed where appropriate for reusability

### Pure Functions

Most game logic is implemented as pure functions that:
- Take inputs and return outputs without side effects
- Don't rely on external state outside their parameters
- Are easy to test in isolation
- Can be composed to create more complex behaviors

### React Component Structure

React components follow a consistent pattern:
- Functional components with hooks
- Props are explicitly typed
- Side effects are managed with useEffect
- Component responsibilities are clearly defined and focused

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach includes:
- Unit tests for core game mechanics
- Component tests for UI elements
- Comprehensive type testing to ensure interface compatibility
- Test mocks for external dependencies

Example test in `__tests__/types.test.ts`:
```typescript
test('calculateHitChance should return lower value when behind cover', () => {
  const attacker = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  const target = { x: 1, y: 1 };
  
  const normalHitChance = calculateHitChance(attacker, target, false);
  const coverHitChance = calculateHitChance(attacker, target, true);
  
  expect(coverHitChance).toBeLessThan(normalHitChance);
});
```

## Future Considerations

- **Scalability**: The folder structure is designed to support expansion to Fallout 2 scale
- **Modularity**: Components and game logic are separated to allow for easier maintenance
- **Testing**: Jest configuration is in place to support testing as the codebase grows
- **Asset Management**: Structure accommodates the addition of many assets as they're created
- **Performance Optimization**: The current architecture allows for future optimizations like:
  - Memoization of expensive calculations
  - Selective rendering of game elements
  - Chunking of large game maps

## Integration Points

### React <-> Phaser Integration

The integration between React and Phaser is managed through the GameCanvas component, which:
- Initializes Phaser in a React-managed div
- Provides lifecycle management for the Phaser instance
- Will handle communication between Redux state and Phaser's internal state

### Redux <-> Game Logic Integration

Game logic functions are pure and don't directly interact with Redux. Instead:
- Redux actions call game logic functions with current state
- Functions return new state that is then stored in Redux
- React components subscribe to relevant parts of the Redux state
- This separation allows for easier testing and maintenance

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing the features outlined in the implementation plan while maintaining code organization and scalability.

## Game Engine Integration

The game engine integration connects Phaser with React and Redux to handle game rendering and state management.

### Components

#### GameCanvas Component (`src/components/GameCanvas.tsx`)

This component serves as the primary connection between React and Phaser:

- Initializes and renders the Phaser game within a dedicated `div` container.
- Uses `BootScene` as the initial scene to ensure proper data loading before `MainScene` starts.
- Manages the Phaser game instance lifecycle (creation/destruction).
- Can include UI overlays (like player position) positioned absolutely over the canvas.

#### GameController Component (`src/components/GameController.tsx`)

The GameController acts as the central hub for handling user input and orchestrating game flow, especially combat turns:

- Listens for keyboard events (movement, attack, end turn).
- Dispatches Redux actions based on input (e.g., `movePlayer`, `executeAttack`, `switchTurn`).
- Validates player actions against game rules (walkable tiles, AP cost).
- Manages the enemy turn sequence using `useEffect` hooks, state variables (`currentEnemyTurnIndex`, `isProcessingEnemyAction`), and `setTimeout` for delays.
- Calls enemy AI (`determineEnemyMove`) and dispatches resulting enemy actions.
- Dispatches messages to the `logSlice` for display in the `LogPanel`.
- Displays a minimal turn indicator UI.

### Game Engine

#### MainScene Class (`src/game/scenes/MainScene.ts`)

This is the central Phaser scene that renders the game world:

- Subscribes to the Redux store to reflect state changes
- Renders the grid-based map with different tile types
- Handles player sprite positioning and movement
- Manages rendering updates when game state changes
- Implements proper cleanup on scene shutdown

### State Management

The Redux store serves as the single source of truth for game state:

- Player state (position, health, inventory) is managed in `playerSlice.ts`
- World state (map, entities, time) is managed in `worldSlice.ts`
- Game actions are dispatched through Redux actions
- Phaser subscribes to state changes and updates visuals accordingly

### Data Flow

1. User input captured by `GameController`.
2. `GameController` validates input and dispatches Redux actions (`playerSlice`, `worldSlice`, `logSlice`).
3. Redux reducers update the store state.
4. `MainScene` (subscribed to `worldSlice`, `playerSlice`) detects changes and updates Phaser visuals (player/enemy position, health text).
5. React UI components (`PlayerStatusPanel`, `LogPanel`, subscribed to `playerSlice`, `logSlice`) detect changes and re-render.

This architecture creates a clean separation of concerns:
- Game logic and state are managed in Redux
- Rendering and graphics are handled by Phaser
- UI components are built with React
- Communication between layers is handled through Redux state

This approach provides several benefits:
- Game state can be easily saved/loaded
- Time travel debugging is possible with Redux DevTools
- Components can be tested independently
- Game logic is decoupled from rendering details

## Grid-Based Movement System

The grid-based movement system is a core component of the game, providing the foundation for player navigation, combat positioning, and interaction with the environment.

### Key Components

#### Grid System (`/src/game/world/grid.ts`)

This file defines the core grid functionality:

- **Grid Creation**: Functions to create empty grids, basic map areas, and test maps with obstacles
  - `createEmptyGrid`: Creates a 2D array of MapTile objects with default properties
  - `createBasicMapArea`: Generates a map area with walls around the edges
  - `createTestMapArea`: Creates a more complex map with internal walls and cover for testing

- **Position Validation**:
  - `isPositionInBounds`: Checks if a position is within the map boundaries
  - `isPositionWalkable`: Determines if a position can be moved to (not a wall or out of bounds)
  - `getAdjacentWalkablePositions`: Returns all valid positions that can be reached in one step

- **Map Manipulation**:
  - `addWalls`: Adds walls to specific positions in a map area
  - `addCover`: Adds cover elements that provide tactical advantages during combat

- **Coordinate Conversion**:
  - `gridToPixel`: Converts grid coordinates to pixel positions for rendering
  - `pixelToGrid`: Converts pixel coordinates to grid positions for input handling

#### Movement Controller (`/src/components/GameController.tsx`)

Manages player input and movement:

- Captures keyboard input (arrow keys and WASD)
- Validates movement against the grid before updating position
- Handles action point costs for movement during combat
- Provides visual feedback when movement is blocked
- Prevents movement during combat if it's not the player's turn

#### Visual Rendering (`/src/game/scenes/MainScene.ts`)

Renders the grid and player:

- Draws the grid with visual elements for different tile types
- Updates player sprite position based on grid coordinates
- Uses distinctive visual indicators for walls, cover, and floor tiles
- Subscribes to Redux state changes to refresh rendering when needed

### Movement Workflow

1. **Input**: Player presses movement key (arrow or WASD)
2. **Validation**: GameController checks if the new position is walkable
3. **State Update**: If valid, Redux action updates player position
4. **Rendering**: MainScene responds to state change and updates visual position
5. **Feedback**: If invalid, feedback message appears to indicate blocked movement

### Map Structure

Maps use a 2D array of MapTile objects with properties:
- **type**: The tile type (FLOOR, WALL, COVER, etc.)
- **position**: Grid coordinates
- **isWalkable**: Whether the player can move onto this tile
- **provideCover**: Whether the tile offers combat advantages

### Integration with Redux

The grid system integrates with Redux through:
- **worldSlice**: Stores the current map area and handles map state changes
- **playerSlice**: Manages player position and movement-related actions
- **Subscription**: MainScene subscribes to state changes to update rendering

### Testing

The movement system is thoroughly tested with unit tests that verify:
- Grid creation with correct dimensions
- Wall and cover placement
- Pathfinding and adjacency calculation
- Position validation and boundary checking

This grid-based system provides a foundation for future enhancements like combat, NPC movement, and more complex environments.

## Combat System

The combat system is a turn-based framework that manages interactions between the player and enemies, providing a tactical experience with elements like action points, attack mechanics, and enemy AI.

### Key Components

#### Combat Mechanics (`/src/game/combat/combatSystem.ts`)

This module provides the core combat functionality:

- **Action Point System**: Both player and enemies have action points (AP) that limit actions per turn
  - Movement costs 1 AP per tile
  - Attacks cost 2 AP and deal configurable damage
  - When an entity runs out of AP, their turn ends

- **Attack Mechanics**:
  - `executeAttack`: Handles attack logic including hit chance calculation and damage application
  - `calculateHitChance`: Determines probability of hitting based on distance and cover
  - Damage system that reduces target health while respecting constraints like minimum health (0)

- **Movement During Combat**:
  - `canMoveToPosition`: Validates if an entity can move to a position based on adjacency and obstacles
  - `executeMove`: Updates entity position and deducts the appropriate AP cost

- **Turn Management**:
  - `initializeCombat`: Prepares entities for combat by resetting action points
  - `endCombatTurn`: Switches turn between player and enemies, refreshing AP for the next active entity

#### Enemy AI (`/src/game/combat/enemyAI.ts`)

The AI module governs enemy behavior during combat:

- **Decision Making**:
  - `determineEnemyMove`: Core function that decides the best action based on current state
  - Prioritizes attacking if player is in range
  - Seeks cover when health is low
  - Moves toward player when out of range

- **Tactical Positioning**:
  - `moveTowardPlayer`: Calculates optimal move to approach the player
  - `seekCover`: Finds and moves toward cover positions
  - `findNearestCover`: Locates the closest cover element

- **Position Evaluation**:
  - `getAdjacentPositions`: Identifies all possible move options
  - Distance calculations to determine optimal positioning

### Integration with Redux

The combat system integrates with Redux through:

- **World State**:
  - `inCombat` flag indicates when combat is active
  - `isPlayerTurn` tracks whose turn it is
  - `createEnemy` and `spawnEnemy` functions create enemy entities

- **Player State**:
  - Tracks health, action points, and position
  - `updateActionPoints` and `updateHealth` actions modify player state during combat

### Visual Representation

The combat is visualized through:

- **MainScene**:
  - Renders enemies as red squares with health indicators
  - Displays player and enemy positions on the grid
  - Shows combat status and current turn

- **Game Controller**:
  - Handles player input for combat (spacebar to attack)
  - Provides feedback for combat actions
  - Shows information about the current combat state

### Combat Flow

1. **Initiation**: Combat begins when the player moves adjacent to an enemy or attacks using spacebar
2. **Player Turn**: Player spends AP on movement and attacks until AP is depleted or turn is ended
3. **Enemy Turn**: Each enemy uses AI to make decisions and spend their AP
4. **Turn Cycling**: Turns alternate until combat ends (all enemies defeated or player disengages)

### Test Coverage

The combat system is thoroughly tested with:

- Unit tests for attack mechanics and hit calculation
- Tests for movement validation during combat
- Verification of turn management and AP system
- Tests for enemy AI decision-making logic

This combat architecture provides a foundation for tactical gameplay and can be extended with additional features like different weapon types, special abilities, and more complex enemy behaviors.
