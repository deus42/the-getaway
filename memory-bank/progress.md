# Project Progress

## Step 1: Initialize the Project (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Created a new Vite project with TypeScript and React using the following technologies:
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - React for UI components
   - Vite for build tooling and development server
   - Phaser for game rendering
   - Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Jest for testing

2. Set up project folder structure as specified in the implementation plan:
   - Project is organized with `/memory-bank` for documentation and `/the-getaway` for the actual game
   - Inside `/the-getaway/src`:
     - `assets`: For images, sounds, and other media files
     - `components`: For React UI components, including the `GameCanvas` component
     - `game`: For game logic, with subfolders for different modules
       - `combat`: Combat system code
       - `world`: World, map, and environment code
       - `quests`: Quest and dialogue systems
       - `inventory`: Inventory management
       - `interfaces`: Character attributes and interfaces
     - `store`: Redux store configuration and state management
     - `styles`: CSS stylesheets and UI design

3. Created placeholder files in each directory to ensure imports work correctly.

4. Configured Tailwind CSS and PostCSS for styling.

5. Set up Jest for testing (configuration files created, but tests need refinement).

6. Created basic `GameCanvas` component that integrates with Phaser to render a game canvas.

7. Set up Redux store for state management.

### Notes:

- The development server is running and displays the Phaser canvas with text "The Getaway".
- Basic scaffolding is in place for all major systems, ready for feature implementation.
- Some test configuration issues need to be resolved in future steps.
- Project now has the correct folder structure with the game in the `/the-getaway` directory.

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 2: Structure the Project Files, by filling out the actual functionality in each module.
