# Project Progress

## Step 1: Initialize the Project (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Scaffolded a Vite + React + TypeScript workspace with Phaser, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Jest.
2. Established the agreed `/memory-bank` + `/the-getaway` repository layout and seeded placeholder modules.
3. Wired Tailwind/PostCSS, configured Jest, created a basic `GameCanvas`, and bootstrapped the Redux store.

### Notes
- Development server renders a placeholder Phaser canvas and the tooling baseline is ready for feature work.

## Step 2: Structure the Project Files (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Authored type definitions and gameplay systems across `game/*` (player, combat, AI, world, inventory, quests, dialogue).
2. Added Redux slices for player/world/quests and combined them into the store.
3. Delivered foundational unit tests in `__tests__/types.test.ts`.

### Notes
- Gameplay subsystems are modular, pure, and fully typed—ready for engine integration.

## Step 3: Embed the Game Engine (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Extended `GameCanvas` to bootstrap Phaser scenes and sync with Redux.
2. Built `MainScene` rendering and subscriptions; added `GameController` for keyboard input and AP-aware combat moves.
3. Created unit tests to confirm Redux state updates driven by engine events.

### Notes
- Rendering is decoupled from logic, and the player sprite now moves live in Phaser.

## Step 4: Add Grid-Based Player Movement (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Enhanced `grid.ts` with obstacles, cover tiles, and walkability guards.
2. Improved tile visuals and added feedback for invalid moves.
3. Added grid/pathfinding/bounds tests.

### Notes
- Movement respects map geometry, laying the groundwork for tactical play.

## Step 5: Build a Basic Combat System (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Implemented AP-driven turns (move = 1 AP, attack = 2 AP) with 5 damage baseline.
2. Rendered enemies/health bars in `MainScene` and added combat messaging.
3. Delivered AI behaviours and tests covering attacks, AP usage, and turn switching.

### Maintenance Notes (Sep 27–28, 2025)
- Fixed trapped-enemy stalls, enforced NPC occupancy rules, added click-to-approach dialogue, and persisted briefing summaries.

## Step 6: Introduce Cover Mechanics & UI Overhaul (Completed)

Date: March 27, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

3. Refined grid rendering for consistent borders and smooth resizes.

## Step 7: Design a Small Explorable Map (Completed)

Date: June 7, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Authored Slums and Downtown areas with door connections stored in `worldMap.ts`.

## Step 8: Add a Day-Night Cycle (Completed)

Date: April 5, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished

## Step 10: Harden Curfew Pressure and Cover Feedback (Completed)

Date: September 25, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Built a curfew alert state machine with escalating patrol responses.
2. Authored `curfew.test.tsx` and highlighted cover tiles during lockdowns.

## Step 11: Expand Downtown into Enterable Megablocks (Completed)

Date: September 26, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Rebuilt `worldMap.ts` into a 144×108 district with interiors and validated doors.
2. Seeded NPCs, loot caches, and persistent enemies; updated door handling to respect curfew.

## Step 12: Create an NPC with a Routine (Completed)

Date: September 26, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Scheduled NPC movement between routine points and reserved destination tiles.
2. Extended pathfinding to avoid NPC stacking and cleaned up timeouts on area change.

### Validation
- `yarn test src/__tests__/curfew.test.tsx`

## Step 13: Set Up a Dialogue System (Completed)

Date: February 14, 2026

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Enabled proximity interaction (press `E`) to open dialogues.
2. Built `DialogueOverlay` with branching options, quest hooks, and Esc-to-close.
3. Added `dialogueOverlay.test.tsx` for UI coverage.

### Validation
- `yarn test src/__tests__/dialogueOverlay.test.tsx --watch=false`

## Step 14: Add a Skill Check to Dialogue (Completed)

Date: September 27, 2025

## Step 17: Pivot Rendering to Neon Isometric Grid (Completed)

Date: September 26, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Reprojected `MainScene` to an isometric layout with recalibrated metrics and camera bounds.

1. Implemented breadth-first pathfinding with enemy avoidance and door awareness.
2. Emitted tile click events, rendered path previews, and queued path execution in `GameController`.
3. Expanded camera/log handling for long routes and synced `tsconfig` with the new event modules.

### Validation

## Step 19: Implement Guard Perception & Alert States (Completed)

Date: September 29, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished

1. Extended `Enemy` type with `VisionCone`, `AlertLevel`, `alertProgress`, and `lastKnownPlayerPosition`.
2. Created `perception.ts` module with vision cone calculations, line-of-sight checks, and alert state transitions.

4. Added vision cone rendering to `MainScene` with color-coded overlays based on alert level.
5. Integrated perception processing into `GameController` with automatic enemy alert updates.
6. Implemented reinforcement spawning when enemies reach `ALARMED` state.

### Validation
- `yarn build` – successful
- `yarn lint` – no errors
- Vision cones render in MainScene with isometric projection
- Alert states escalate: IDLE → SUSPICIOUS → INVESTIGATING → ALARMED
- Reinforcements spawn automatically when alarm threshold is reached
- Alert messages appear in action log with proper localization
