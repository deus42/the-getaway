# Project Progress

## Step 1: Initialize the Project (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Created a new Vite project with TypeScript and React using the following technologies:
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - React for UI components
   - Vite for build tooling and development server
   - Phaser for game rendering
   - Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Jest for testing

2. Set up project folder structure as specified in the implementation plan:
   - Project is organized with `/memory-bank` for documentation and `/the-getaway` for the actual game
   - Inside `/the-getaway/src`:
     - `assets`: For images, sounds, and other media files
     - `components`: For React UI components, including the `GameCanvas` component
     - `game`: For game logic, with subfolders for different modules
       - `combat`: Combat system code
       - `world`: World, map, and environment code
       - `quests`: Quest and dialogue systems
       - `inventory`: Inventory management
       - `interfaces`: Character attributes and interfaces
     - `store`: Redux store configuration and state management
     - `styles`: CSS stylesheets and UI design

3. Created placeholder files in each directory to ensure imports work correctly.

4. Configured Tailwind CSS and PostCSS for styling.

5. Set up Jest for testing (configuration files created, but tests need refinement).

6. Created basic `GameCanvas` component that integrates with Phaser to render a game canvas.

7. Set up Redux store for state management.

### Notes:

- The development server is running and displays the Phaser canvas with text "The Getaway".
- Basic scaffolding is in place for all major systems, ready for feature implementation.
- Some test configuration issues need to be resolved in future steps.
- Project now has the correct folder structure with the game in the `/the-getaway` directory.

## Step 2: Structure the Project Files (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Defined comprehensive type system in `interfaces/types.ts`:
   - Created Position, Entity, Player, Enemy, and NPC interfaces
   - Defined Item, Weapon, Armor, and Consumable types
   - Implemented Quest and Dialogue system interfaces
   - Created MapTile and MapArea interfaces for world representation

2. Implemented player system in `interfaces/player.ts`:
   - Defined default player configuration with skills and attributes
   - Created functions for player movement, health modification, and leveling
   - Implemented action point management for turn-based gameplay

3. Developed robust combat system in `combat/combatSystem.ts`:
   - Created attack mechanics with hit chance calculation
   - Implemented cover system that affects damage and accuracy
   - Built position-based targeting and range calculation
   - Added turn management with action point costs

4. Created enemy AI in `combat/enemyAI.ts`:
   - Implemented decision-making for enemies during combat
   - Added cover-seeking behavior for wounded enemies
   - Created utility functions for enemy movement and targeting

5. Built a grid-based world system in `world/grid.ts`:
   - Implemented map generation with wall placement
   - Created functions for checking walkable positions and obstacles
   - Added cover placement for tactical gameplay
   - Implemented utility functions for grid-to-pixel conversion

6. Developed day-night cycle in `world/dayNightCycle.ts`:
   - Created configurable time system with morning/day/evening/night transitions
   - Implemented light level calculations for visual effects
   - Added curfew detection for gameplay mechanics
   - Built time update functions based on real-time progression

7. Implemented inventory system in `inventory/inventorySystem.ts`:
   - Created weight-based inventory management
   - Built item creation functions for weapons, armor, and consumables
   - Implemented item usage with various effects
   - Added inventory sorting and organization functions

8. Created quest system in `quests/questSystem.ts`:
   - Implemented quest creation and tracking
   - Built objective completion logic for different objective types
   - Created reward distribution system
   - Added helper functions for quest management

9. Built dialogue system in `quests/dialogueSystem.ts`:
   - Implemented dialogue tree structure
   - Created skill check functionality for conditional dialogue options
   - Added quest-dialogue integration for quest giving/completion
   - Implemented dialogue navigation and option selection

10. Implemented Redux state management:
    - Created player state slice in `store/playerSlice.ts`
    - Built world state management in `store/worldSlice.ts`
    - Implemented quest and dialogue state in `store/questsSlice.ts`
    - Updated store configuration to combine all reducers

11. Created comprehensive tests in `__tests__/types.test.ts`:
    - Tested player defaults and attributes
    - Verified combat system mechanics
    - Validated grid and world systems
    - Confirmed inventory and quest functionality

12. Fixed TypeScript configuration issues:
    - Updated `tsconfig.json` for proper JSX support
    - Added ESM interoperability for better module support
    - Fixed configuration for proper Jest testing

### Notes:

- All core game mechanics are now defined with proper typing and functionality
- Each module is built with immutability and functional programming patterns
- Redux store is configured to manage all game state efficiently
- Tests are passing and validate core functionality
- The code is modular and follows clear separation of concerns
- Linting issues have been identified and addressed

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 3: Embed the Game Engine, which will focus on enhancing the Phaser integration and connecting the Redux state to the game renderer.

## Step 3: Embed the Game Engine (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Enhanced the GameCanvas component to integrate Phaser with React:
   - Updated the component to use a dedicated Phaser scene for game rendering
   - Connected to the Redux store to sync game state with UI
   - Added responsive canvas that displays the current game world

2. Created a dedicated MainScene class:
   - Implemented a grid-based rendering system for the game world
   - Added player representation on the grid
   - Connected to Redux store for state management
   - Set up automatic re-rendering on state changes

3. Implemented GameController component for input handling:
   - Added keyboard control for player movement (arrows/WASD)
   - Connected to Redux to dispatch actions on user input
   - Integrated collision detection with the game world
   - Added action point management for movement during combat

4. Established a bidirectional communication layer between Phaser and Redux:
   - Set up Redux subscriptions in the Phaser scene
   - Created rendering functions that update on state changes
   - Implemented clean event handling with proper lifecycle management

5. Developed comprehensive tests for the game engine integration:
   - Created unit tests for the Redux store updates
   - Verified player movement and game state updates
   - Set up Phaser mocking for testing in Jest

### Notes:

- The game now renders a grid-based world with the player represented as a blue square
- Player can be moved using arrow keys or WASD, and the position updates in real-time
- The application correctly displays the player's position in the UI
- Redux state changes are immediately reflected in the game display
- Tests verify that the core game mechanics are working correctly
- The architecture separates game logic from rendering, following good practices

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 4: Add Grid-Based Player Movement, which will focus on enhancing movement with proper collision detection and obstacles.
