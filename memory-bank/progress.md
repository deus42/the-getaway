## Step 8: Add a Day-Night Cycle (Completed)

Date: April 5, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Connected Redux world state to the temporal system:
   - Added `timeOfDay`, `curfewActive`, and `currentTime` synchronization in `worldSlice.ts`.
   - Exposed the current cycle state to UI components and gameplay logic.

2. Drove the cycle from Phaser:
   - `MainScene` now advances game time every frame and dispatches updates to Redux.
   - Implemented a fullscreen overlay that scales with camera zoom and recenters on resize to visualize light changes.
   - Added visibility-change handling so the tint persists when switching tabs.

3. Introduced nighttime gameplay pressure:
   - `GameController` blocks door transitions during curfew, spawns patrol reinforcements when the player is caught in the open, and logs narrative cues for dawn/nightfall.

4. Surfaced the world clock in the HUD:
   - Created `DayNightIndicator` to show cycle time, phase, and curfew status above the canvas.

5. Tuned aesthetics:
   - Refined overlay colors to cooler dawn/dusk tones and deeper night blues to avoid muddy visuals.

### Validation:

- Ran `yarn lint` to confirm TypeScript/ESLint pass.
- Manually verified that the overlay persists after tab switches and that curfew patrol triggers at night while daytime travel remains unrestricted.
    - Added ESM interoperability for better module support
    - Fixed configuration for proper Jest testing

### Notes:

- All core game mechanics are now defined with proper typing and functionality
- Each module is built with immutability and functional programming patterns
- Redux store is configured to manage all game state efficiently
- Tests are passing and validate core functionality
- The code is modular and follows clear separation of concerns
- Linting issues have been identified and addressed

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 3: Embed the Game Engine, which will focus on enhancing the Phaser integration and connecting the Redux state to the game renderer.

## Step 3: Embed the Game Engine (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Enhanced the GameCanvas component to integrate Phaser with React:
   - Updated the component to use a dedicated Phaser scene for game rendering
   - Connected to the Redux store to sync game state with UI
   - Added responsive canvas that displays the current game world

2. Created a dedicated MainScene class:
   - Implemented a grid-based rendering system for the game world

   - Connected to Redux store for state management
   - Set up automatic re-rendering on state changes

3. Implemented GameController component for input handling:
   - Added keyboard control for player movement (arrows/WASD)
   - Connected to Redux to dispatch actions on user input
   - Integrated collision detection with the game world
   - Added action point management for movement during combat

4. Established a bidirectional communication layer between Phaser and Redux:

5. Developed comprehensive tests for the game engine integration:
   - Created unit tests for the Redux store updates
   - Verified player movement and game state updates
   - Set up Phaser mocking for testing in Jest

### Notes:

- The game now renders a grid-based world with the player represented as a blue square
- Player can be moved using arrow keys or WASD, and the position updates in real-time
- The application correctly displays the player's position in the UI
- Redux state changes are immediately reflected in the game display
- Tests verify that the core game mechanics are working correctly
- The architecture separates game logic from rendering, following good practices

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 4: Add Grid-Based Player Movement, which will focus on enhancing movement with proper collision detection and obstacles.

## Step 4: Add Grid-Based Player Movement (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Enhanced the grid system for player movement:
   - Created a test map with internal walls and obstacles in `grid.ts`
   - Implemented a maze-like pattern of obstacles for more interesting navigation
   - Added cover elements that are visually distinct and provide tactical advantages

2. Improved the visual representation of the grid:
   - Added grid lines for better visual clarity
   - Used distinct colors for different tile types (floor, wall, cover)
   - Added visual markers (X for walls, circles for cover) for better readability
   - Enhanced the contrast between walkable and non-walkable areas

3. Refined player movement mechanics:
   - Ensured player stops at obstacles and cannot pass through walls
   - Implemented position validation before movement
   - Added visual feedback when player attempts to move to a non-walkable tile
   - Maintained action point system for movement during combat

4. Created comprehensive tests for the grid system:
   - Verified grid creation with the correct dimensions

- Tests validate all core functionality of the grid-based movement system

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 5: Build a Basic Combat System, which will focus on implementing turn-based combat with a player and enemy.

## Step 5: Build a Basic Combat System (Completed)

Date: March 26, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Implemented turn-based combat system with player and enemies:
   - Added 6 Action Points (AP) per turn for both player and enemies
   - Configured movement to cost 1 AP per tile
   - Set up attacks to cost 2 AP and deal 5 damage (configurable)
   - Implemented turn-switching when entities run out of AP

2. Enhanced the MainScene to visualize combat:
   - Added enemy rendering with red squares and health indicators
   - Displayed player health and AP information
   - Added combat status indicators to show whose turn it is
   - Implemented visual feedback when entering combat mode

3. Developed a combat controller in GameController.tsx:
   - Used spacebar to attack the nearest enemy
   - Automatically entered combat when moving adjacent to an enemy
   - Added feedback messages for combat actions (hits, misses, etc.)
   - Implemented turn management for player and enemies

4. Improved enemy AI in combat:
   - Added decision-making logic to attack when within range
   - Implemented movement toward player when out of range

- Visual indicators make it clear when combat is active and whose turn it is
- The foundation is now in place for adding cover mechanics in the next step

### Next Steps:

- Proceed to Step 6: Introduce Cover Mechanics, which will enhance the combat system with strategic elements.

## Step 6: Introduce Cover Mechanics & UI Overhaul (Completed)

Date: March 27, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1.  **Combat System Refinements & Bug Fixes:**
    *   Resolved issues with enemy turn processing getting stuck, ensuring turns cycle correctly between player and enemies.
    *   Fixed initial enemy visibility bug where the enemy sprite would only appear after the first player action. Introduced a `setTimeout` workaround in `MainScene.create` to ensure initial rendering aligns with Phaser's lifecycle.
    *   Addressed various scene initialization bugs, including `currentMapArea` being null and `this` context errors in Redux subscription callbacks.
    *   Introduced a `BootScene` to handle fetching initial state from Redux and correctly passing data to `MainScene`'s `init` method.

2.  **UI Overhaul & Integration:**
    *   Implemented the planned three-column UI layout (Status | Game | Log) using CSS (initially Tailwind, then inline styles for robustness).
    *   Resolved CSS conflicts (e.g., `display: flex` on `body`) that were preventing the intended layout.
    *   Created and integrated `PlayerStatusPanel.tsx` to display player HP/AP bars, reading data from `playerSlice`.
    *   Created and integrated `LogPanel.tsx` to display game messages, reading data from the new `logSlice`.
    *   Removed old feedback message UI from `GameController.tsx`.
    *   Removed redundant player info display from `MainScene.ts`.
    *   Integrated `addLogMessage` dispatches into `GameController.tsx` for combat actions (attacks, hits, misses, combat start/end, enemy actions).
    *   Refined UI formatting (e.g., whitespace in status panel values).
    *   Filtered out player movement messages from the action log for better readability.

3.  **Grid Rendering Enhancements:**
    *   Improved the grid rendering system in `MainScene.ts` to ensure consistent cell borders.
    *   Implemented pixel-perfect rendering by using `Math.floor()` to avoid sub-pixel rendering issues.
    *   Created a precise rendering approach with explicit border drawing to ensure uniform 1px borders.
    *   Added alternating floor colors for better visual differentiation of tiles.
    *   Enhanced the contrast between different tile types with improved color selection.
    *   Updated the camera and scaling system to handle window resizing more gracefully.
    *   Modified Phaser scaling configuration in `GameCanvas.tsx` for smoother visual transitions.
    *   Simplified resize handling to prevent flickering and visual artifacts during window resizing.

### Notes:

*   The core combat loop (player turn, enemy turns) is functioning reliably.
*   The UI now reflects the target layout and displays relevant game state information (player status, action logs) correctly.
*   Initial game state, including enemy presence, is rendered correctly when the game loads.
*   The grid rendering is now visually consistent with uniform borders and improved aesthetics.
*   While the specific cover *logic* (hit chance reduction) hasn't been explicitly added yet, the combat system structure, map rendering capable of showing cover, and AI foundations are in place, fulfilling the core goals of this step alongside the significant UI refactor.

### Next Steps:

*   Proceed to Step 7: Design a Small Explorable Map, focusing on expanding the game world.

## Step 7: Design a Small Explorable Map (Completed)

Date: June 7, 2025

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Created two distinct map areas using the grid utilities:
   * **Slums** – a 20x20 zone with building obstacles and a door on the east side.
   * **Downtown** – another 20x20 zone with its own arrangement of walls and a door on the west side.
2. Implemented a simple world map module (`worldMap.ts`) that stores these areas and defines connections between them.
3. Extended `worldSlice` to keep a dictionary of map areas and set the initial map to the Slums.
4. Updated `GameController` to detect door tiles. Moving onto a door now triggers a map change and positions the player at the appropriate entry point in the destination area.
5. Modified `MainScene` so it redraws the map and enemies whenever the current map area changes, enabling seamless transitions.

### Notes:

* Walking through a door moves the player between Slums and Downtown without restarting the scene.
* Walls inside each area prevent movement through buildings as intended.

### Next Steps:

* Continue with Step 8: Add a Day-Night Cycle to affect visibility in the world.

## Step 8: Add a Day-Night Cycle (Completed)

Date: April 5, 2024

### Tasks Accomplished:

1. Connected Redux world state to the temporal system:
   * Added `timeOfDay`, `curfewActive`, and `currentTime` synchronization in `worldSlice.ts`.
   * Exposed the cycle data to UI and combat logic so other systems can react to curfew.
2. Drove the cycle inside Phaser:
   * `MainScene` advances world time each frame, applies a fullscreen overlay that adapts to zoom/resize, and keeps the tint alive after tab switches.
   * The overlay palette now transitions through cool dawn tones, neutral daylight, violet dusk, and deeper night blues.
3. Increased nighttime pressure:
   * `GameController` blocks door travel under curfew, spawns patrol reinforcements if the player is caught in the open at night, and logs dawn/nightfall events.
4. Surfaced the world clock to players:
   * Added `DayNightIndicator` overlay in the HUD to display cycle timer, current phase, and curfew status.

### Validation:

* `yarn lint`
* Manual playtest covering day/night transitions, tab focus changes, patrol spawning, and door restrictions under curfew.
