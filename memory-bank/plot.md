# The Getaway: Plot Bible

## Setting Snapshot — United States, 2036
- **Climate**: Subtropical storms lash the Atlantic coast; sea walls and flood pumps fail weekly.
- **Government**: Chancellor Victor Harrow rules through the **Emergent Security Directorate (ESD)**, a fusion of privatized police, militias, and corporate intelligence.
- **Economy**: Ration tokens, black-market scrip, and corporate credit chips coexist. Critical infrastructure is auctioned to loyal oligarchs.
- **Technology**: Drones, predictive policing, and biometric checkpoints keep cities contained; the resistance relies on repurposed industrial tech and analog dead drops.
- **Alliances**: The **North Atlantic Resistance Coalition (NARC)**—Canada, EU remnants, and sympathetic Latin American states—fund covert cells but cannot intervene overtly.

## Core Conflict
Harrow’s regime is staging **Operation Cold Iron**—a lightning strike into Canada to seize hydroelectric power and rare earth reserves. The player’s actions will decide whether the invasion succeeds or collapses, exposing Harrow’s war crimes to the world.

## Narrative Pillars
1. **Occupation as Everyday Reality**: Every mission should remind players that the regime polices food, information, and movement. Small victories (lifting curfew in one district) matter as much as grand strikes.
2. **Trust is Currency**: Alliances are fragile. Mechanics around reputation, dialogue checks, and companion loyalty stem directly from who the player chooses to protect.
3. **Tech vs. Ingenuity**: High-end regime technology collides with hacked-together resistance solutions. Gameplay systems should reflect asymmetry—smart traps, misdirection, and social engineering trump brute force.
4. **Consequences Echo**: Decisions reverberate through later acts (e.g., sparing a syndicate broker unlocks Act III smuggling assistance; leaking intel early hardens ESD patrols in Act IV).

## Key Power Factions
- **Emergent Security Directorate (ESD)**: Brutal, data-obsessed enforcers wearing graphite armor and mirrored visors. Internal rivalry between traditionalist commanders and profit-driven corporate officers creates exploitable fractures.
- **North Atlantic Resistance Coalition (NARC)**: Operatives supply intel, tech smuggling routes, and extraction contacts. They favor long-term destabilization over open war.
- **Miami Cell "Shelterline"**: Grassroots network led by **Amara Velez**, a former Coast Guard officer. Specializes in disrupting port logistics and covert evacuations.
- **Scavenger Syndicates**: Opportunistic crews such as the **Dockside Brokers** trade ration chips, weapon mods, and intel to anyone. They can swing toward or away from the player depending on respect earned.
- **Corporate Collaborators**: The **Eisenclave Conglomerate** profits from surveillance contracts and privatized utilities, providing Harrow with drone swarms and AI analysis.

## Protagonist Profile (Player-Created)
- **Callsign**: Default "Trace", customizable during character creation.
- **Background Threads** (unlocked later steps):
  - *Former Courier*: Knows smuggling tunnels; excels at stealth objectives.
  - *Disgraced Cadet*: Access to old ESD protocols; dialogues with loyalists differ.
  - *Street Medic*: Unique pacifist options and leverage over refugee factions.
- **Personal Stakes**: Trace’s father vanished during the Battle of Miami; rumors hint he survived as an ESD detainee moved north with Operation Cold Iron.

## Narrative Structure
### Act I — "Ashes of Miami"
- Break curfew to retrieve contraband medkits.
- Meet **Shelterline** at an abandoned metro hub; prove worth by disabling drone beacons.
- Discover evidence that Harrow’s forces are funneling munitions north by cargo rail.

### Act II — "Fault Lines" (Mid-Atlantic Corridor)
- Travel via refugee caravans and damaged highways; choices affect faction reputation.
- Infiltrate Eisenclave data centers to expose Operation Cold Iron’s logistics.
- Secure NARC extraction, but witness infighting between pragmatists and idealists.

### Act III — "Glass Capital"
- Enter New Columbia (former Washington, D.C.), now a walled corporate arcology.
- Work with double agent **Commander Sadiq Rahm** to sow distrust inside ESD ranks.
- Decide whether to leak intel to the public (risking blowback) or keep leverage for NARC.

### Act IV — "Northern Breakpoint"
- Sabotage the invasion’s staging yards hidden beneath Great Lakes freight tunnels.
- Trigger a citywide blackout or hijack the drone swarm—player choice determines finale tone.
- Final confrontation with Harrow on an airborne command platform; expose crimes, topple regime, or negotiate a fragile ceasefire.

### Act Interludes & Convergence Beats
- **Radio Monologues**: Between acts, run shortwave broadcasts from Theo “Circuit” summarizing public sentiment; branch based on player reputation scores.
- **Refugee Ledger**: Persistent menu tab tracking civilians saved, lost, or displaced. Numbers influence NARC’s willingness to deploy assets in Act III and IV.
- **Harrow’s Address**: A mid-campaign propaganda speech adapts to player disruptions (lost trains, leaked intel) and unlocks bespoke dialogue hooks for the finale.

## Supporting Cast
- **Amara Velez**: Tactical lead of Shelterline. Direct, dry humor, prioritizes civilian safety.
- **Theo "Circuit" Anders**: Teenage hacker broadcasting pirate radio bulletins; brings levity and exposition.
- **Commander Sadiq Rahm**: Decorated ESD officer whose family defected to Canada. Dialogue oscillates between clipped military jargon and suppressed grief.
- **Dr. Mireille Duplessis**: NARC liaison coordinating aid drops; speaks in measured, diplomatic tones underscored by urgency.

## Tone & Dialogue Guidelines
- **Resistance Voices**: Grounded, hopeful under exhaustion. Use coded phrases ("streetlight" = safe house, "quiet tide" = curfew lift). Slang pulls from Spanish, Creole, and tech jargon.
- **ESD Officers**: Precise, ominous. Reference protocols (“Compliance Directive 19-B”) and statistics. Avoid profanity; intimidation derives from chilling calm.
- **Civilians & Syndicates**: Survival-first. Sentences trail off, punctuated by quick checks over the shoulder. They bargain, joke darkly, and call the player by nickname.
- **Broadcast Media**: Propaganda layered with glitchy interference. Pair authoritarian slogans with cheery corporate sound bites.

### Dialogue Style Reference
- **Resistance Example**: “Streetlight’s back on. You’ve got seven minutes before the floodlights sweep—move like you still trust your knees.”
- **ESD Example**: “Citizen Trace. Compliance Directive 19-B authorizes lethal countermeasures. Present for scan or be marked subversive.”
- **Syndicate Example**: “You bring fuel? Then we talk. No fuel, no favors—curfew makes saints of none of us.”
- **Broadcast Tagline**: “Harrow’s Dawn—Order, Prosperity, Destiny. Stay inside. Stay loyal. Stay alive.”

## Themes & Motifs
- **Improvised Hope**: Makeshift solar arrays, graffiti maps, and coded lullabies show culture persisting.
- **Silenced Histories**: Museums turned into bunkers; characters fight for memory as much as freedom.
- **Moral Weight**: Each major mission forces a choice—protect civilians, gather intel, or strike the regime. Consequences ripple through faction reputation and future support.

## Quest Hooks & Side Threads
- **Echoes of the Bay**: Rescue climate refugees trapped in a seized cruise liner; decide who boards limited smugglers’ ferries.
- **The Stadium Vault**: Looted arts and archives stored under Miami Stadium—choose between public broadcast or black-market leverage.
- **Signal Choke**: Disable a satellite uplink relay; success unlocks covert NARC drops, failure boosts enemy patrol AI.
- **Ghost Ledger**: Track ration fraud implicating a sympathetic ESD quartermaster; decide whether to expose or protect them.

## Recurring Visual & Audio Motifs
- **Neon vs. Sodium Glow**: Resistance zones use reclaimed neon signage; regime checkpoints drown in amber floodlights.
- **Soundscape Cues**: Faint radio static indicates nearby pirate broadcasts; low-frequency hum warns of patrol drones.
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Flooded storefronts repurposed as hydroponic farms, painted murals of missing persons, ration lines stretching past corporate billboards.

## Future Expansion Seeds
- **Industrial Wasteland**: After Harrow falls, chemical weapon stockpiles leak in the Midwest—ties into game update Step 31.
- **Vehicle Underground**: Motorcycle network intersects with Shelterline safe routes, bridging to Step 27.1 content.
- **Survival Mode Tie-In**: Hunger/thirst mechanics reflect refugee supply chains, adding narrative weight to Step 28.1 systems.

Use this plot bible to align missions, cinematics, and dialogue. Any new narrative beat should reinforce the core conflict (Operation Cold Iron), escalate faction stakes, or deepen the player’s personal connection to dismantling Harrow’s regime.
