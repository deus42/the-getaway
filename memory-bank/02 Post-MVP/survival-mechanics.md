# Post-MVP: Survival Mechanics (full system)

Moved out of memory-bank/01 MVP/Game Design.md to keep the MVP doc focused.

## Balance values (survival)

Survival Mechanics

Survival elements ensure the player must manage more than just enemies – the environment and basic needs are challenges too, enhancing immersion and difficulty:
	•	Hunger (Food): The player character needs to eat periodically to maintain peak performance. We’ll have a hunger meter or a simple counter that increases over time. For example, a character might need to eat two meals per day. If the player goes too long without food, they incur penalties: lowered strength (representing weakness), slower health regeneration if any, and eventually health loss if starving. Eating food reduces hunger and can even give small buffs (a well-fed bonus like slightly faster healing or a boost to morale that could tie into stamina). Different foods fill different amounts and have trade-offs: canned food is heavy but non-perishable; fresh food is lighter and more nutritious but can spoil after a day or two if not used (spoilage could be simulated simply by a timer or left out for realism). The player can hunt animals in the outskirts or scavenge for food in houses (old world packaged foods, etc.), and purchase in settlements. High survival skill might help identify edible wild plants or get more meat from animals.
	•	Thirst (Water): If included, thirst would work similarly: need water at least once a day, more often if doing strenuous activities or in hot zones. Water sources in the city might be contaminated, requiring purification (boiling, tablets). If thirst is too micromanage-y, we might fold it into hunger (like assume meals include water) or make it a less frequent concern.
	•	Fatigue (Sleep): The character needs rest. We track fatigue or exhaustion as a meter that fills as the player remains active (especially after combat, long travel, carrying heavy loads). If fatigue goes high, the character’s effectiveness drops: aim gets shaky, maximum AP might reduce (hard to concentrate when very tired), and maybe dialogues reflect the character’s exhaustion. To reduce fatigue, the player must sleep. They can sleep in safe beds (at safehouses, camps) for full recovery, or do shorter rests (like 1-hour naps) for partial recovery if a safe spot is available. Sleeping advances time, which could mean missing some timed events or encountering night/day as a result. If the player tries to push without sleep, at extreme fatigue levels we could induce hallucinations or random fainting (though that might frustrate, so a gentler cap is better: e.g., after 24 hours no sleep, you’re at maximum fatigue penalty but still playable).
	•	Injuries & Medical Treatment: Beyond the HP bar, specific injuries can occur. For instance, taking a lot of damage from a fall could break a leg (movement penalty until treated), or certain enemies might inflict bleeding (lose HP over time until bandaged) or poison (requires antidote). These conditions require medical supplies or a doctor NPC to cure. We might implement a simple system: normal healing items cure HP but not severe injuries, which need a “doctor’s bag” or hospital visit. Survival/medical skill helps self-treat injuries in the field (like craft a splint).
	•	Radiation & Toxins: In a dystopian city, there could be irradiated zones or chemical spills. Exposure might raise a radiation meter which, if high, reduces max health or causes sickness until cured with anti-rad medicine. Similarly, toxic gas in some areas might require a gas mask; without it, you take damage or stat debuffs. This encourages carrying the right gear when exploring unknown areas.
	•	Weather/Environmental Hazards: Dynamic weather like acid rain could harm the player if caught outside (slowly reducing health or armor condition) unless they find cover or wear protective clothing. Extremely hot conditions (maybe in industrial fires) or cold (if any climate variation) could accelerate hunger/thirst or fatigue. While the city is mostly temperate, if there’s an outskirts desert or a flooded zone, each might have unique survival considerations (dehydration risk in desert, need a boat or risk drowning in flooded zones).
	•	Disease: Possibly, the player can catch illnesses from contaminated food, water, or enemy attacks (mutant rats might give disease). These could impose stat penalties that persist until cured. Antibiotics or rest could cure diseases. This adds another reason to keep your supplies and base clean, and maybe to do quests that improve living conditions (a quest could be to fix a water purifier for a settlement – helping them and giving you a safe water source).
	•	Stress/Mental State: We might not simulate mental health deeply, but one could imagine a morale system (especially if the game ever adds party companions). For MVP, this is represented primarily by Paranoia and lightweight narrative tone shifts.
	•	User Interface & Feedback: Survival meters (if used) will be visible but not overly intrusive. Perhaps small icons: a fork/knife for hunger, a water drop for thirst, a zzz for fatigue, changing color as they get dire. Tooltips or status screen show exact values and effects. When hungry or tired, the game might occasionally prompt in text (“Your stomach rumbles” or “You feel very tired.”).
	•	Difficulty Tuning: We might allow players to adjust how demanding the survival elements are. On an easier setting, hunger/thirst could be very slow to matter, and fatigue less punishing. On hardcore mode, you might need to eat every few hours, and starvation can kill you quickly. This customization ensures players who want the full survival experience get it, and those who want to focus on story can tone it down.
	•	Integration with Other Systems: The survival needs tie into the economy (need to buy or find food/water), exploration (seek safe places to rest, find water sources), and faction interactions (maybe only certain factions have access to clean water or safe camps, giving incentive to befriend them). It also adds weight to vehicle travel; in a car, you can carry more supplies and potentially have a place to rest (sleeping in the car might be possible, albeit less effective than a bed).

Survival mechanics add realism and tension. They ensure that even without enemies around, the player is planning and managing resources. It turns the game partially into a survival RPG without overwhelming the core tactical/quest gameplay, as long as we balance it to be engaging rather than tedious. The constant need to eat, drink, and rest in a dangerous city can create memorable emergent moments (e.g., desperately searching for food while injured and only encountering threats). It makes the dystopian world more than a backdrop – it's something to endure and overcome.
