# Post-MVP: Crafting & Upgrades

Moved out of memory-bank/01 MVP/Game Design.md to keep the MVP doc focused.

Crafting & Upgrades (Post-MVP)

**Status:** ❌ DEFERRED FOR MVP - Deep crafting is out of the vertical-slice scope. MVP may include only lightweight scripted quest pickups/consumables, not a full crafting economy.

Crafting allows players to create or improve items using resources gathered, adding a layer of strategy and self-sufficiency:
	•	Resource Gathering: As the player explores, they find raw materials. This could be explicit scavenging (clicking a scrap pile to get scrap metal) or as loot from containers/enemies (electronics from a destroyed robot, herbs from a garden, chemicals in an abandoned lab). We might categorize resources in broad types to keep it simple (e.g., “Metal Parts”, “Electronic Components”, “Chemicals”, “Textiles”, etc.). Higher crafting skills might allow extracting more components from the same source (a perk could be “Scrapper: get 50% more materials from looting machinery”).
	•	Crafting Stations vs Field Crafting: Some basic crafting (like making a bandage from cloth) could be done anytime from the inventory menu. More advanced recipes might require being at a workbench, chemistry station, or garage. Safehouses and certain friendly locations would have these stations. We might allow a portable toolkit item that lets you craft certain things in the field with a penalty or slower speed.
	•	Crafting Recipes: Players start with a set of simple recipes (like how to cook raw meat to not get sick, or crafting a lockpick from scrap metal). Additional recipes are learned through: leveling up crafting-related skills, reading in-game manuals (loot or buy a “Mechanics Monthly” magazine to learn a couple of new weapon mods), or being taught by NPCs (“I can show you how to mix a potent explosive”). We could also allow experimentation: if a player tries a reasonable combination of items, the game might allow discovery of a recipe (“You’ve combined chemical A and B… you discovered how to make a basic grenade”). However, to keep it user-friendly, most recipes will be explicitly given rather than pure trial-and-error.
	•	Categories of Craftable Items:
	•	Ammunition: e.g., craft arrows, bullets (using casings + powder + scrap metal for bullets, energy cells from batteries, etc.). This will be important if shops are few or to make special ammo types (incendiary rounds, EMP grenades).
	•	Medical Supplies: craft bandages from cloth, herbal remedies from plants, stimulants or antidotes by combining chemicals. Possibly craft a drug to temporarily boost combat ability at cost of later fatigue.
	•	Food & Drink: cook raw meat (prevent disease), purify water via filters or boiling, brew coffee for fatigue reduction, etc. Survival skills improve yield (like getting more portions out of ingredients).
	•	Weapon Upgrades/Mods: build a scope for a rifle (needs glass and metal), a suppressor (needs engineering skill and metal), extended magazine, or even jerry-rig a basic firearm. Maybe convert one weapon type to another (sawn-off shotgun from a shotgun, etc.).
	•	Explosives & Tools: make grenades, molotovs (bottle + alcohol + cloth), mines (using some electronics + explosive), EMP devices (electronics + rare components), lockpicks, hacking spikes (disposable tools to hack easier).
	•	Armor & Gear: reinforce armor (sew kevlar into a jacket if you have kevlar plates), craft makeshift armor from scrap (not very effective but better than nothing), upgrade a backpack for more capacity, or craft utility items like a climbing rope/grappling hook.
	•	Vehicle Mods: at a garage, use scrap and parts to upgrade vehicles (armor plating, better engine parts, spiked bumpers as mentioned). Also craft repair kits or refuel using combined chemicals if gasoline is scarce (like making biofuel).
	•	Upgrade Mechanics: Upgrading typically means taking an existing weapon/armor and improving it. We might have a quality level system (e.g., Pistol I, II, III or Common/Uncommon/Rare quality). The player can bring materials to improve a pistol’s damage or reduce its AP cost via tuning. Each upgrade requires increasingly advanced parts or skills. This system gives a way to keep a favorite weapon viable longer rather than discarding it when new ones drop. However, there will be limits (a basic revolver won’t ever outdo a top-tier plasma gun, but you can make that revolver pretty decent if you sink resources into it).
	•	Crafting Skill Influence: The character’s crafting-related skills (like Engineering, Chemistry, etc.) could impose limits or affect success:
	•	Some recipes require a certain skill level to even appear or be used.
	•	Perhaps a chance of failure for complex crafts if skill is just at the threshold (fail could waste some materials).
	•	Higher skill might let you craft faster or yield more output (e.g., make 10 bullets instead of 5 per batch).
	•	Economy and Crafting: Crafting gives an alternate economy. If merchants don’t sell what you need, you can craft it. It also provides a money-making avenue: craft items from cheap components and sell the product at profit (we have to watch that for balance). Possibly some high-tier gear can only be crafted, not bought, giving crafters a unique edge.
	•	User Interface: A crafting menu lists known recipes, highlighting which ones you have materials for. Selecting a recipe shows required ingredients and outputs. The player confirms to craft, time passes (maybe a few in-game minutes to hours depending on complexity). Some items might be crafted near-instantly (bandage a wound), others could take in-game time (manufacturing ammo might take an hour). We decide if the time factor is needed or if it’s simplified.
	•	Encouraging Crafting: To encourage engagement, we’ll integrate crafting into some quests (like NPC asks for a crafted item, or you need to craft a makeshift bomb to open a sealed door if you didn’t bring one). Additionally, crafted gear could have slight advantages (a crafted medkit might heal a bit more than a found one, because you tailored it to your needs, etc.). This makes the system rewarding rather than optional fluff.

Crafting and upgrades serve players who enjoy planning and optimization. It fits the survival theme (make do with what you find) and adds another layer of progression (improving equipment, not just stats). It's entirely possible to play with minimal crafting (buying what you need or using found items), but those who invest in it will find themselves better equipped and possibly saving resources by recycling and creating what they need.
