# Post-MVP: Vehicles

Moved out of memory-bank/01 MVP/Game Design.md to keep the MVP doc focused.

Integration of Vehicles (Post-MVP)

<implementation_status>❌ DEFERRED FOR MVP - Vehicles are out of the vertical-slice scope. Revisit Post-MVP.</implementation_status>

Vehicles add an extra dimension to both exploration and combat in The Getaway:
	•	Combat Entry with Vehicles: If a combat encounter triggers while the player is using a vehicle (e.g., driving through hostile territory and getting ambushed), the vehicle is present on the combat grid. The player can choose to fight from the vehicle or disembark. (If Post-MVP ever adds companions, they may also start mounted, but MVP assumes a single protagonist.)
	•	Vehicle as Unit: A vehicle in combat is treated like a large unit. It has its own stats: health (durability), possibly armor, and maybe separate components (tires that can be shot out, an engine that can be damaged, etc.). Enemies can target the vehicle, and some may prioritize disabling it to remove the player’s mobility.
	•	Movement & Ramming: The player can spend AP to move the vehicle on their turn. Vehicles can cover more ground per AP than characters, but are limited by terrain (they can’t go indoors or through very rough terrain on the grid). A vehicle can also be used as a weapon: ramming an enemy with a car can deal massive damage or outright kill weaker foes. Ramming might have a chance to knock the vehicle off course or cause some self-damage, balancing its power.
	•	Mounted Weapons: Certain vehicles might be equipped with mounted weapons like a turret or plow. For example, an armored car could have a roof-mounted machine gun that the player can operate (and Post-MVP companions could operate as well). Using a mounted weapon costs AP from whoever is controlling it. These weapons often have a wide firing arc and high damage output, turning the vehicle into a formidable combat asset.
	•	Mobile Cover & Transport: A vehicle provides mobile cover. Characters can hide behind a vehicle to shield themselves from gunfire. They can also use the vehicle to reposition quickly on the battlefield – driving to a safer spot or evacuating allies. Getting in or out of a vehicle during combat costs some AP, so players need to time entry/exit carefully (for instance, diving into the car when under heavy fire, or jumping out before the vehicle becomes a death trap).
	•	Damage and Repairs: Vehicles can be damaged or even destroyed in combat. If a vehicle’s health drops to zero, it might become wrecked and non-functional, or potentially explode if it’s that type of vehicle (causing area damage). The player will then need to survive on foot and later repair or replace the vehicle. Repairing a vehicle can be a post-combat task or even an action by a mechanically-inclined character during combat (using AP to jury-rig fix a few HP).
	•	Balancing Vehicles: While vehicles provide advantages (speed, protection, firepower), the game will balance encounters so they’re not unbeatable tanks. Enemies may have anti-vehicle weapons (like EMP grenades to stall an engine, or heavy arms like rocket launchers). Some combat scenarios (tight indoor spaces, rooftops) simply won’t allow vehicles, forcing the player to proceed on foot. Also, fuel considerations (see Survival mechanics) might mean the player saves vehicle use for when it’s really needed.

By integrating vehicles, combat scenarios become more diverse. One fight might be a tense on-foot shootout in a claustrophobic warehouse, and the next could be a running battle where the player drives their truck through barricades while exchanging fire with a gang. It gives the player more tactical choices and a sense of continuity between exploration and combat.

Vehicles in Exploration (Post-MVP)

Vehicles are not just for combat; they are essential tools for open-world traversal and tie into multiple gameplay systems:
	•	Acquisition: The player may acquire vehicles through quests, purchase, or theft. Early in the game, they might start on foot, then get a basic vehicle (like a beat-up car or bike) by helping a mechanic or stealing one from enemies. As the game progresses, better vehicles become available (e.g., an armored truck or a high-speed bike). Each vehicle type has its own advantages (speed, durability, storage space).
	•	Travel & Overworld Map: Driving reduces travel time significantly. If the game features any sort of world map or distance simulation, vehicles lower the chance of encounters because you spend less time exposed. However, they might have specific encounter types (like roadblocks or car chases) that you wouldn’t get on foot. The player can typically drive on roads or open areas; attempting to go off-road in a city environment might mean crashing or getting stuck (we can keep some realistic limitations to avoid trivializing navigation puzzles).
	•	Fuel Management: Most vehicles require fuel (gasoline, diesel, or maybe battery charge for electric ones). Fuel is a resource found in the world or bought from certain traders (or stolen from fuel depots). This acts as a limiting factor on vehicle use; the player must consider how far they can go and carry spare fuel if going on a long trip across the city or outskirts. Running out of fuel in a hostile area could leave the player stranded until they find more, which adds an element of survival strategy.
	•	Storage & Inventory: Vehicles have trunks or storage compartments. The player can stash extra weapons, ammo, or loot in the vehicle rather than carrying it all on their person. This encourages using the vehicle as a mobile base when exploring far from a safehouse. However, accessing the trunk might be unsafe during combat (you’d need to be at the vehicle and spend time), so it’s more for before/after combat planning. If a vehicle is lost or stolen, any items in it would be temporarily lost too (the player might have to retrieve the vehicle or catch the thieves to get their stuff back).
	•	Upgrades & Customization: Players can upgrade vehicles at garages or by using their Mechanics skill. Upgrades include better engines (faster travel and acceleration), reinforced bumpers (more damage when ramming and less damage to the vehicle), armor plating (higher durability and resistance to gunfire), spikes or blades on wheels (to discourage melee attackers from approaching), improved storage capacity, better headlights (for night travel), and mounted weapons. Cosmetic customization (paint jobs, decals) might also be available for personalization, though primarily aesthetic.
	•	Vehicle Damage & Theft: In the open world, vehicles can be damaged by rough driving or attacks. If you drive through a firefight, stray bullets might hit your car. Repairing a vehicle requires tools and parts, which the player can carry or find at a workshop. If you leave your vehicle unattended in a dangerous area, NPC thieves might attempt to steal it or strip it for parts. The player could invest in anti-theft upgrades (like an alarm or steering lock) to mitigate this. There could even be a dynamic where if your car is stolen, you get a quest or map marker to get it back from a chop-shop.
	•	Alternate Transportation: Besides personal vehicles, the city might have remnants of public transit or other travel means. For example, maybe an old subway system can be reactivated or used for fast travel between certain points (if the player clears it of monsters or repairs the generators). Or perhaps there’s a train that runs occasionally between districts that the player can hitch a ride on (safe but on a schedule and fixed route). These alternatives can add flavor and options but are not as flexible as having your own ride.

By incorporating vehicles into exploration, the game offers players flexibility in how they experience the open world. You can cruise through danger zones quickly or go on foot to stealthily scavenge, and each choice has its own set of consequences and gameplay implications. Vehicles also serve as a form of player progression – acquiring a better vehicle feels like a significant milestone and opens up new possibilities (much like getting a ship in a space game or a horse in a medieval RPG).
