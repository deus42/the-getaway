Character Creation & Progression

Character Creation: At the start of the game, the player creates their protagonist. They may be able to customize:
	•	Appearance: (If visually represented) Choose gender, look, possibly a portrait or 3D model customization for face, hair, etc. Since it’s a top-down game, we might keep visuals simpler (like picking a sprite/portrait and outfit).
	•	Background: Select a background or origin story. Each background provides a slight perk and influences starting reputation or dialogue. For example: Ex-Cop might start with a slight reputation boost with security forces and a small firearms skill bonus; Street Urchin could start with higher stealth and contacts in the slums; Corporate Tech might have better hacking and an in with corporate factions. Backgrounds give flavor and a starting point but do not lock the player into a specific class or path.
	•	Attributes: Allocate points to primary attributes. A likely set could be Strength (melee damage & carry weight), Agility (AP and stealth), Endurance (health and resistances), Intelligence (skill points gain and hacking/tech ability), Perception (aim and critical chance, detecting traps), Charisma (influence and barter). The player has a limited pool to distribute, shaping their initial strengths and weaknesses. Attributes might influence derived stats (like Agility -> AP, Endurance -> fatigue threshold, etc.).
	•	Skills: The player might also allocate some skill points or choose a few “tag skills” that they are especially good at from the start. Skills correspond to the skill trees (like Small Guns, Energy Weapons, First Aid, Lockpicking, etc.). Tagging a skill could give an immediate boost and faster progression in that skill. Alternatively, instead of point allocation, we might have the player answer a few backstory questions or pick a template that sets starting skills to align with their background (similar to some Fallout games).

Progression System:
	•	Experience and Leveling: The player gains Experience Points (XP) from various activities: defeating enemies, completing quests (major XP), successful use of skills (maybe minor XP for picking a lock or hacking a computer), and discovering new locations. After accumulating enough XP, the player levels up. We’ll likely have a level cap or diminishing gains after a certain point to balance the game length. Level-ups are moments to improve the character.
	•	Skills and Perks: On leveling up, the player either gets skill points to distribute among their skills (raising their percentages or ranks), or they might directly get to pick a perk from a skill tree. We can combine both: e.g., each level gives a few skill points and every few levels you pick a special perk. Skills might be ranked from 0 to 100 or 0 to 10; each point invested increases effectiveness. High skill levels unlock new actions (e.g., at Hacking 50 you can hack advanced locks, at 80 you can hack security robots). Perks are more unique bonuses or abilities you choose, such as “Thief: +20% success chance on stealing and lockpicking” or “Medic: using a medkit heals 15% more”.
	•	Skill Trees: If we take a tree approach, skills are grouped by category, and advanced skills or perks have prerequisites. For instance:
	•	Combat Tree: Might have branches for Guns, Melee, Explosives. Early skills might be basic proficiency (+damage or accuracy), mid-tier might unlock abilities (like a double-tap shot or a power attack), high-tier might be very powerful passives or moves (like an aimed shot that costs no AP once per fight).
	•	Tech Tree: Branches for Hacking, Engineering, Science. Could unlock crafting recipes, the ability to hack turrets to your side, building your own robotic companion at high level, etc.
	•	Survival Tree: Branches for Medicine, Stealth, Scavenging. Improves healing, adds stealth kills or silent movement, increases loot quantity/quality, ability to find rare resources or navigate hazardous zones safely.
	•	Social Tree: Branches for Persuasion, Intimidation, Barter. Unlocks better prices, more dialogue options, maybe the ability to recruit followers or call for truce in combat through dialogue.
	•	Capstones: Each tree might have a capstone perk that is a defining ability. For example, a combat capstone might be “Gun Fu: AP cost for the first shot each turn is 0,” tech capstone “Master Engineer: you can craft advanced energy weapons,” survival capstone “Iron Stomach: no negative effects from bad food and resistance to toxins,” social capstone “Kingpin: you can have one faction become loyal to you no matter previous reputation once per game.” Capstones encourage specializing, but a player can only get one or two in a single playthrough realistically.
	•	Balance of Builds: We want multiple viable builds. A player who invests in combat will find fights easier and can go head-on. A stealthy/tech player might avoid many fights but have other ways around obstacles (hacking a door instead of fighting guards). A charismatic player could navigate factions diplomatically, accessing content a warlike character might miss. We ensure key challenges have multiple solutions (for instance, a final mission can be done with brute force or by rallying allies or by stealth infiltration, depending on character strengths).
	•	Companions’ Progression: If the game allows companion characters, they will also improve over time, either automatically or through a simpler leveling system. The player might not micromanage their every skill, but could choose a focus (tell a companion to get better at sniping vs melee, for example). Some companions might have their own mini skill trees or perk choices when they level up, often reflecting their personality or story (a companion who is an ex-medic could gain an upgraded healing ability after completing their personal quest, etc.).
	•	Late Game Progression: As players approach the endgame, they should feel significantly more powerful than at start, but not invincible. Enemies scale in difficulty to some extent (later areas have tougher foes), though not necessarily level-scaling every foe – rather, the world has high-level dangers you learn to handle. The progression should allow players to specialize deeply or diversify, but there’s a trade-off: a specialist is superb in their field (like unbeatable in small arms combat) but weak in others (poor at hacking or speech), whereas a generalist can handle many situations but isn’t the absolute best at any, which is also viable.

The goal is that character progression feels rewarding and lets the player define their approach to the game. Every level is a chance to refine your character concept, unlock new abilities that change how you play, and react to the challenges you've been facing (e.g., "I need more hacking to get past those security doors, better level that up next time").

<mechanic name="karma_system">
<rule type="morality">
Karma System (Morality)

Parallel to faction reputation, the game tracks the player's overall karma or morality based on their actions. This Karma system influences the narrative tone and some game mechanics:
	•	What Affects Karma: Virtually any significant action that has moral weight will adjust karma. Examples: saving innocents, showing mercy, and helping without reward will increase karma (good). Acts like murder of non-hostiles, betrayal, extortion, and unnecessarily cruel decisions will decrease karma (evil). Minor actions typically won’t budge it (stealing a loaf of bread might be too minor, unless we have a lot of petty theft adding up). We ensure the player knows when an action is major enough to affect karma, usually through context or explicit feedback (“You feel a pang of guilt for what you’ve done…” or a UI icon).
	•	Karma Scale: Karma can be represented on a scale from very bad to very good. We may give ranks or titles at certain thresholds (for flavor). For example, below -100 karma = “Wicked”, -50 to -99 = “Ruthless”, 0 = “Neutral”, +50 = “Kindhearted”, +100 and above = “Saintly”. These titles could appear on the character sheet and NPCs might refer to the player with nicknames or rumors based on this (“People say there’s a devil roaming these streets…” vs “Some say an angel of mercy is out there helping those in need.”).
	•	Gameplay Effects of Karma:
	•	NPC Interactions: Some NPCs only deal with the player if they have a certain karma. A settlement of peaceful monks might refuse entry to a known killer (low karma), or a black-market arms dealer might not trust someone with too high of karma (thinking them a goody-two-shoes who might turn them in).
	•	Quest Availability: A few quests might only trigger at certain karma levels. For instance, a vigilante might approach a high-karma player with a request to help bring justice, whereas a crime boss might only offer a dirty job to someone with demonstrated ruthlessness.
	•	Companion Relationships: If companions are included, their approval might tie to karma. A morally upright companion could argue with or even leave a low-karma player over time. A pragmatic or evil companion might chafe if the player is too soft.
	•	World Reactions: Guards might be more suspicious of a notorious player (extra searches or harassing dialogue), whereas a beloved hero might get small perks like free lodging from grateful citizens.
	•	Self-Contained Perks: We might include a few perks or abilities tied to karma: e.g., high karma gives a small boost to influence friendly NPCs (“Inspiring Presence”), low karma might give intimidation bonuses (“Fearsome Reputation”). These would be subtle so as not to force a particular playstyle just for a mechanical benefit.
	•	Karma and Endings: As mentioned earlier, the karma level can influence the tone or even nature of the ending. High karma might lead to endings where even if the player fails to save the city, they are remembered fondly or someone continues their good work. Low karma might result in betrayal or an ending where the player’s empire collapses because it was built on fear. The exact interplay will be written to suit each ending scenario, but karma ensures the ending feels congruent with the player’s approach (like an epilogue line “Citizens rejoiced at the fall of the tyrants, and hailed the stranger who had helped them” vs “Citizens traded one tyrant for another, as the stranger ruled with the same cruelty they had fought against”).
	•	Player Agency with Karma: The game doesn’t label any path as the “wrong” way – karma is not a score to maximize unless the player chooses to role-play that way. We want both high and low (and neutral) karma playthroughs to be viable and interesting. The system’s goal is to provide feedback and consequences, not to punish the player for being “bad” or “good.” There will be pros and cons at both ends, encouraging the player to consider morality as part of their strategy and storytelling rather than just min-maxing for advantage.

In short, Karma adds a layer of personal morality to the game's feedback loop. While faction reputation deals with external alliances, karma reflects the kind of person the player character is in this world, and the game world responds in kind.

<mechanic name="reputation_system">
<rule type="faction_relations">
Reputation System

Reputation tracks the player's standing with specific factions (and possibly notable sub-groups or communities) and is distinct from karma:
	•	Faction Reputation Meters: Each major faction (and minor ones like guilds or towns) has a reputation value for the player. These can range from hostile to neutral to friendly to allied. The game UI will display these, often with a numeric value or a descriptive tier. For example: City Police: Hostile (25/100 toward Neutral), Warlords Gang: Allied (90/100 toward Maximum). This transparency helps players gauge their relations.
	•	Gaining & Losing Reputation:
	•	Completing quests for a faction increases rep with them (and often lowers with their enemies).
	•	Helping faction members in random events (saving a patrol, healing a wounded member) can give small boosts.
	•	Conversely, killing faction members, betraying them in quests, or aiding their rivals will lower reputation.
	•	Some actions have immediate rep effects even outside quests (if you attack a faction’s base unprovoked, you become hostile with them at once).
	•	There may be opportunities to restore rep after a fallout, like performing an appeasement task or paying tribute, if narratively appropriate.
	•	Reputation Benefits/Penalties:
	•	At Friendly/Allied rep: The faction’s NPCs won’t attack you (and will in fact greet or guard you). Prices at their shops drop, and they might give you gifts or access to better gear. You may gain permission to enter restricted areas like their armory or VIP sections. They could send backup if you are attacked in their territory. Ultimately, you might even be offered formal membership or leadership roles in the faction’s storyline if your rep is maxed.
	•	At Neutral rep: The faction treats you like any other wastelander. You can trade or talk in their territory, but you get no special treatment. You might have to pay bribes or show passes to get into certain areas. Quests are available if you ask, but they might not seek you out.
	•	At Unfriendly/Hostile rep: Unfriendly might mean they warn you to leave or dislike you (higher shop prices, rude dialogues). Hostile means they attack on sight and you cannot peacefully enter their turf. Hostile factions might also send out hit squads or assassins to target you during exploration as revenge for past deeds. Some factions (like creatures or raiders) start hostile by default to everyone.
	•	Inter-faction Diplomacy: If the player somehow balances between factions (e.g., stays neutral or mildly positive with multiple groups), they can act as a go-between or peacemaker in some cases. There could be quests where having decent rep with two groups lets you broker a deal instead of them fighting. This is a rewarding outcome for players who try to maintain neutrality and play all sides.
	•	On the flip side, being hated by everyone (low rep across the board due to very selfish play) makes the final parts of the game different – you might have no allies to call on, making some sequences harder but perhaps allowing a “lone wolf” notorious ending.
	•	Individual Reputation: Aside from factions, certain unique NPCs or merchants could track a personal reputation or relationship with the player. A lone weapons dealer might give better deals only after you complete a personal quest for him. A companion character might have loyalty which improves as you do their quests and make decisions they agree with. These are more like relationship values but work similarly to rep. We will include them on a limited basis for key characters.
	•	Feedback: As with karma, the game will give feedback on rep changes. Finishing a quest might show “+15 reputation with The Resistance” and perhaps “-10 with Corporate Security”. If you cross a threshold (like going from Neutral to Friendly), an NPC might reach out (an emissary says “Our leader wishes to thank you for your help…”) or you get a new dialogue (“You’ve proven yourself a friend to us. We welcome you in our camp.”). Similarly, hitting Hostile triggers a warning or immediate change in world behavior. The quest journal or a faction menu can remind players what their current standing allows (“Allied: You can request equipment drops from this faction” or “Hostile: Do not enter their main base unless prepared for a fight”).

The reputation system ensures that the player's actions have clear and varied impacts on their relationships in the world. It adds a strategic component: you might decide not to do a tempting quest for Faction A because you don't want to anger Faction B you've been working with. Or you might deliberately betray a faction at the end of their quest line for a big reward, knowing full well it'll make them enemies. It's all about choices and consequences, quantified in a way players can monitor and react to.
