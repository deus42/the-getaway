# Implementation Plan for "The Getaway" (Base Game)

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

### Step 1: Initialize the Project
- **Instructions**: Set up a new project using TypeScript, React, and Vite for a browser-based game. Use Yarn for package management.
- **Details**: 
  - Create the project with the Vite CLI and configure Yarn workspace.
  - Install essential libraries: Phaser for game rendering, Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Jest for testing.
- **Test**: Run the project locally. Verify that a basic webpage loads in the browser without errors, showing a default template or blank screen.

### Step 2: Structure the Project Files
- **Instructions**: Organize the project into a clear, modular folder structure to separate game logic, UI, and assets.
- **Details**: 
  - Create top-level folders: `src/assets` (for images, sounds), `src/components` (React UI), `src/game` (game logic), `src/store` (state management), and `src/styles` (CSS).
  - Inside `src/game`, add subfolders: `combat`, `world`, `quests`, `inventory`, and `interfaces`.
  - Design the structure with scalability in mind, following Fallout 2 as a reference for game scale and complexity.
- **Test**: Create a dummy file in each folder (e.g., `test.ts`) and import it into the main entry file. Ensure no import errors occur when the project runs.

### Step 3: Embed the Game Engine
- **Instructions**: Integrate Phaser into a React component to display the game canvas.
- **Details**: 
  - Create a `GameCanvas` component in `src/components`.
  - Set up Phaser to render a blank scene (e.g., a solid color background) inside a `div`.
  - Establish the communication layer between Phaser and React/Redux.
- **Test**: Add the `GameCanvas` component to the main app. Verify that a blank game canvas appears in the browser, and check the console for Phaser initialization messages.

## Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics

### Step 4: Add Grid-Based Player Movement
- **Instructions**: Implement a scalable grid system for player movement in the game world.
- **Details**: 
  - Define an initial 10x10 grid in `src/game/world` for prototyping, but architect the system to support much larger maps (similar to Fallout 2's expansive areas).
  - Add a placeholder player sprite to the canvas and enable movement with arrow keys (up, down, left, right), shifting one tile per press.
  - Include basic obstacles (e.g., walls) on the grid.
- **Test**: Use arrow keys to move the player across the grid. Ensure the player stops at obstacles and cannot pass through them.

### Step 5: Build a Basic Combat System
- **Instructions**: Create a turn-based combat system with a player and one enemy.
- **Details**: 
  - Set up a combat manager in `src/game/combat`.
  - Give each entity (player and enemy) 6 Action Points (AP) per turn. Moving costs 1 AP per tile; attacking costs 2 AP and deals 5 damage.
  - Implement a simple enemy AI that can make basic decisions (approach player if far, attack if within range).
  - Alternate turns between player and enemy.
- **Test**: Trigger combat. Move the player (spending 1 AP per tile) and attack (spending 2 AP). Verify AP decreases correctly, damage is applied, and turns switch after AP is spent. Observe enemy AI behavior.

### Step 6: Introduce Cover Mechanics
- **Instructions**: Add a cover system to enhance combat strategy.
- **Details**: 
  - Mark specific grid tiles as "cover" (e.g., walls, barricades) that fit the dystopian setting.
  - Reduce attack hit chance by 50% if the target is behind cover.
  - Allow enemy AI to recognize and seek cover when at low health.
- **Test**: Position the player and enemy with a cover tile between them. Attack the enemy and confirm the hit chance is reduced. Move the enemy out of cover and verify the hit chance returns to normal.

## Phase 3: Exploration and World Interaction

### Step 7: Design a Small Explorable Map
- **Instructions**: Create a basic open world with multiple connected areas.
- **Details**: 
  - Use a tilemap to build an initial map with two distinct zones (e.g., "Slums" and "Downtown"), each at least 20x20 tiles to provide more exploration space.
  - Design the map architecture to support eventual expansion to Fallout 2-scale environments with multiple districts.
  - Add collision tiles (e.g., buildings, barriers) that match the dystopian setting from the backstory.
- **Test**: Walk the player from one zone to another. Ensure collision tiles stop movement and the transition between zones is seamless.

### Step 8: Add a Day-Night Cycle
- **Instructions**: Implement a day-night cycle affecting visibility and game mechanics.
- **Details**: 
  - Set a 5-minute cycle (2.5 minutes day, 2.5 minutes night).
  - Dim the screen (e.g., add a semi-transparent overlay) during night.
  - Incorporate elements from the backstory - like curfew mechanics or increased security at night.
- **Test**: Start the game and wait 5 minutes. Confirm the screen brightens at the start, dims after 2.5 minutes, and repeats the cycle. Verify that any time-based game mechanics activate appropriately.

### Step 9: Create an NPC with a Routine
- **Instructions**: Add a non-player character (NPC) that moves between locations.
- **Details**: 
  - Define an NPC in `src/game/world` with a schedule (e.g., moves from one location to another during the day).
  - Use basic pathfinding to guide the NPC.
  - Implement simple AI behavior reflecting the dystopian setting (e.g., a merchant, guard patrol, or civilian with routines).
- **Test**: Watch the NPC during the day phase. Verify it moves smoothly from start to end point without getting stuck.

## Phase 4: Narrative and Dialogue System

### Step 10: Set Up a Dialogue System
- **Instructions**: Build a text-based dialogue system with choices that can reflect the game's backstory.
- **Details**: 
  - Create a dialogue manager in `src/game/quests`.
  - Define a simple dialogue tree with options that reflect the dystopian setting (e.g., NPC discusses curfew or regime authorities).
  - Display dialogue in a React overlay above the game canvas with a visually appropriate UI for the setting.
- **Test**: Interact with an NPC. Confirm the dialogue appears, choices are selectable, and the NPC's response changes based on the selection.

### Step 11: Add a Skill Check to Dialogue
- **Instructions**: Integrate a skill-based condition into dialogue options.
- **Details**: 
  - Define player skills relevant to the setting (e.g., Charisma, Intelligence, Stealth) with default values.
  - Add dialogue options that require skill checks (e.g., "Persuade" requiring Charisma > 5).
- **Test**: Set the required skill to a level below the threshold; the option should be locked. Increase it above the threshold; the option should unlock and work when selected.

### Step 12: Implement a Simple Quest
- **Instructions**: Create a basic quest with an objective and reward that fits the game's setting.
- **Details**: 
  - Define a quest in `src/game/quests` that reflects the game's backstory (e.g., "Deliver a message to a resistance member").
  - Track progress in state and show it in a React-based quest log.
  - Reward XP and possibly an item upon completion.
- **Test**: Accept the quest, complete the objective, and turn it in. Verify the quest log updates and rewards are awarded correctly.

## Phase 5: Character Progression and Inventory

### Step 13: Define Player Stats
- **Instructions**: Set up character attributes that suit the dystopian setting.
- **Details**: 
  - Create a player profile in `src/game/interfaces` with appropriate stats (Strength, Perception, Endurance, etc. similar to Fallout's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system).
  - Display stats in a React component with a UI that matches the game's aesthetic.
- **Test**: Load the game and check the stats UI. Change a stat value and confirm the UI reflects the update.

### Step 14: Add a Leveling System
- **Instructions**: Implement XP-based leveling.
- **Details**: 
  - Award XP for completing quests or defeating enemies.
  - Level up at 100 XP, granting skill points to improve character abilities.
  - Design the system to be expandable for higher levels and more complex progression.
- **Test**: Earn 100 XP through quests or combat. Confirm the player levels up and receives skill points that can be allocated.

### Step 15: Build an Inventory System
- **Instructions**: Create a weight-based inventory system.
- **Details**: 
  - Define an inventory in `src/game/inventory` with a realistic weight limit.
  - Add items appropriate to the setting (weapons, supplies, quest items).
  - Implement item categories and sorting options for scalability.
- **Test**: Add items until reaching near the weight limit, then try adding a heavy item. Verify the addition fails due to the weight limit. Check the inventory UI updates correctly.

## Phase 6: Testing and Final Touches

### Step 16: Test the Full Game
- **Instructions**: Playtest the base game to ensure all mechanics work together.
- **Details**: 
  - Explore the map, engage in combat, complete quests, and level up.
  - Focus on fixing gameplay issues and bugs as they appear rather than formal unit testing.
  - Ensure the game runs smoothly in modern browsers.
- **Test**: Confirm combat, exploration, dialogue, and progression function without crashes or major performance issues.

### Step 17: Add Save Functionality
- **Instructions**: Implement a multi-slot save system using browser storage.
- **Details**: 
  - Create a save manager that stores multiple save slots in local storage.
  - Save player stats, inventory, quest progress, and world state.
  - Include options to create new saves, load existing saves, and delete saves.
- **Test**: Create multiple save files at different points in the game. Verify loading each save restores the correct game state, including player position, inventory, and quest progress.

### Step 18: Polish the UI
- **Instructions**: Enhance the user interface for clarity and thematic consistency.
- **Details**: 
  - Style all UI elements (dialogue box, quest log, inventory, status displays) with consistent visuals that fit the dystopian setting.
  - Add tooltips to explain game mechanics and interface elements.
  - Ensure UI is responsive and performs well on modern browsers.
- **Test**: Open each UI element. Ensure they look cohesive and tooltips appear when hovering over interactive elements.

## Summary
This plan outlines 18 implementable steps to build the base version of "The Getaway." It focuses on:
- **Combat**: Turn-based with AP, cover, and simple enemy AI.
- **Exploration**: A scalable map system with day-night cycle and NPC routines.
- **Dialogue**: Branching conversations with skill checks reflecting the game's dystopian setting.
- **Progression**: Character development through stats, leveling, and inventory.

Each step includes a specific test to validate implementation. The architecture prioritizes modularity and scalability, drawing inspiration from Fallout 2 while focusing on creating a solid foundation that can be expanded. Rather than extensive unit testing, we'll use iterative development and playtesting to ensure quality.

Performance is optimized for modern browsers, with an emphasis on fast, responsive gameplay rather than heavy 3D graphics. The visual style and narrative elements will reflect the dystopian backstory while keeping technical requirements reasonable.

This foundation supports future additions like advanced quests, expanded world areas, or multiplayer while keeping the codebase manageable and maintainable.
