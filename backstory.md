# The Getaway: Backstory

## 1. The Seeds of Upheaval (2020–2026)
After a period of severe political division in the early 2020s, a crisis in public trust set the stage for an aspiring autocrat to seize power. The global economy fell into recession, and unemployment soared. Social unrest, protests, and partisan infighting raged. With the world distracted, a cunning political figure emerged, capitalizing on fear and division.

## 2. The Rise of the Dictator (2027–2030)
During the 2028 election, a populist white politician promised stability and rapid economic recovery. He used social media and AI-driven propaganda to target voters and erode his opponents’ reputations, aided by an alliance with a powerful Silicon Valley magnate who controlled much of the country’s data infrastructure. Under a pretense of ‘making the country safe again,’ civil liberties were chipped away, and an ultra-nationalist sentiment spread.

When he took office, he fast-tracked emergency powers to deal with supposed “internal threats,” dissolving watchdog agencies and eliminating political opposition through intimidation or prosecution. Foreign allies expressed concern, but the new administration withdrew from longstanding treaties—NATO, UN climate accords, and various trade agreements—citing that the nation would be stronger on its own.

## 3. Civil War and National Collapse (2031–2032)
Mounting tensions exploded into a short but violent civil war. Several Southern states attempted to break away, forming a coalition opposed to the dictatorship. However, lacking coordinated leadership and facing a well-armed central government, the rebellion was brutally crushed within a year. Key cities like Miami and Atlanta became battlegrounds, with thousands of lives lost.

During this time, Mexico, burdened by its own internal issues, fell under the dictator’s influence. Gangs seeking power and profit struck deals with his regime, turning the entire border region into a complex network of criminal enterprises that served the dictator’s interests.

## 4. The Regime Consolidates Power (2033–2034)
By 2033, the dictator had absolute control over Congress, the judiciary, and nearly all media outlets. Tech industries were nationalized or placed under the direct control of the Silicon Valley magnate—now the government’s ‘Minister of Technological Security.’ Surveillance escalated as data from social media, drones, and biometrics was used to track every citizen’s activities.

Meanwhile, the global community struggled to respond. With the United States retreating from international commitments, the European Union and Canada formed a new alliance for mutual security—later known as the North Atlantic Resistance Coalition (NARC). This alliance enforced sanctions, yet the dictator’s propaganda machine painted foreign condemnation as proof of Western hypocrisy. His approval remained high among supporters due to a manipulative media campaign.

## 5. Proxy Wars and Isolation (2035)
The dictator turned his attention overseas, orchestrating proxy conflicts in Africa to secure resources and exert influence. These wars further drained the U.S. economy, yet the regime spun it as “defending national security interests,” all while conscripting more young Americans to fight abroad.

At home, poverty levels soared, infrastructure decayed, and many once-prosperous areas became grim, heavily policed districts. Resistance movements were forced underground; many fled to Canada or Europe.

## 6. The Year 2036: Tensions Before the Invasion
By now, the dictator’s ambition points north—Canada. Having withdrawn from nearly every alliance, he sees Canada’s wealth of resources as key to sustaining his autocratic empire. Border states bristle with military forces; rumors of an imminent invasion run rampant.

### Miami’s Fall
Miami, once a cultural and economic hub, suffered heavily in the civil war. The Battle of Miami was among the bloodiest engagements, leaving the city a shadow of its former self. Declarations of martial law remain in place; a strict curfew and ‘enemy combatant’ laws allow the regime to detain or execute anyone suspected of disloyalty.

In this near-ruined metropolis lives our 20-year-old protagonist—a survivor who lost his father in the Battle of Miami. Trying to scrape by in a militarized police state, he stumbles into a local resistance cell, unaware that he holds the potential to spark a chain of events leading to the downfall of the regime.

### The Path Ahead
From the shattered streets of Miami to the corridors of power in the new federal capital, the protagonist’s journey reveals the hidden networks of spies, smugglers, and freedom fighters. At the same time, the North Atlantic Resistance Coalition eagerly awaits any chance to weaken the dictator’s grip. Whether or not the invasion of Canada can be stopped—and if the nation can be liberated—depends on the protagonist’s courage and choices.
