## Snapshot
- **Perspective**: Isometric Phaser rendering with neon 2.5-D dressing and tactical overlays.
- **Loop**: Brief in Slums safehouses, navigate Downtown megablocks, battle curfew patrols, and thread dialogue/quest outcomes into the resistance story.
- **State of Level 0**: District-aware props, bilingual content parity, click-to-move traversal, stealth perception, and a fully AI-generated narrative pipeline.

## Latest Transmission
| Date | Drop | Highlights |

## Gameplay Pillars
- **Infiltration Under Curfew**: Nightfall flips the city into lockdown; curfew alerts, patrol reinforcements, and cover callouts keep players hustling between safe zones.
- **Choice-Driven Narrative**: Dialogue trees, faction alignments, and quest hooks respond to skill checks, backgrounds, and bilingual localization.
- **Tactical Combat**: AP economy, cover mechanics, and equipment bonuses blend with skill-driven hit/dodge/crit maths for crunchy encounters.
- **Living Districts**: District metadata drives props, signage, loot, and NPC routines so Slums feel reclaimed while Downtown stays corporate sterile.
- **AI-Led Production**: Content, code, and roadmap execution flow from AI agents—human edits must explicitly document deviations per the license.

## Systems Online
### City & Atmosphere
- **District Overhaul (Step 11.5)**: Procedurally dressed Slums/Downtown blocks with barricades, streetlights, billboards, and neon overlays sourced from `IsoObjectFactory`.
- **NYC Grid Layout (Step 20)**: Four avenues × four streets carve 16 parcels; each door sits on a walkable tile for seamless interior transitions.
- **Day/Night & Curfew (Steps 8, 10)**: Five-minute cycle triggers curfew enforcement, animated cover highlights, and patrol spawns.

### Tactical Layer
- **Movement**: Grid-based keyboard controls plus breadth-first click-to-move with door traversal and path previews (Step 18).
- **Combat Core**: Turn-based AP system, cover penalties, skill-informed accuracy, equipment bonuses, and reinforcement hooks (Steps 5, 6, 19, 23.5).
- **Stealth Readability**: Vision cones, suspicion escalation, and network alerts telegraph when stealth is compromised (Step 19).

### Narrative & Progression
- **Dialogue & Quests (Steps 13–16)**: Branching conversations with skill gates, quest log integration, bilingual strings, and localized HUD feedback.
- **Character Creation (Steps 22.1–22.3)**: Three-step wizard for identity, SPECIAL allocation, and background perks/equipment.
- **Skills & Progression (Steps 23–24.2)**: Derived stat formulas, XP/level-up modal, skill tree branches with combat bonuses, and future perk hooks.

### UX & Accessibility
- Neon HUD arranged in a recon tri-column with minimap, status readouts, and action log.
- Character sheets, skill trees, and overlays support keyboard navigation, ARIA live regions, and bilingual toggles.
- Toast notifications and modal flows surface XP, curfew warnings, and skill gate feedback.
- Layered minimap controller delivers cached tiles, enemy/objective markers, Shift-drag waypoint previews, keyboard panning, and high-contrast/auto-rotate options.

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- **React + Vite** host the HUD, overlays, character creation flow, and modal systems.
- **Phaser** renders isometric districts, token sprites, vision cones, and path previews.
- **Redux Toolkit** persists player/world/quest slices (with `localStorage` hydration and reset hooks).
- **Content Pipeline** keeps authoring data immutable under `src/content/levels/<level-id>/locales/{en,uk}.ts`, cloned into runtime stores.
- **Memory Bank** (implementation-plan, progress, architecture, plot) records roadmap scope, shipping milestones, and narrative canon.

## Working With The Game
```bash
cd the-getaway
yarn install      # first-time setup
yarn dev          # Vite dev server + Phaser canvas
yarn build        # type-check + production bundle
yarn lint         # ESLint across the mono-neon codebase
yarn test         # Jest + Testing Library suites
```

## Content Authoring Pipeline
1. Draft quests, dialogue branches, NPC routines, loot tables, and signage metadata inside `src/content/levels/<level-id>/locales`.
2. Register new IDs through slice loaders—never mutate source exports directly; runtime clones keep authoring files pristine.
3. Update relevant Redux selectors/services (`playerSlice`, `worldSlice`, `questsSlice`, etc.) if systems evolve.
4. Mirror roadmap updates in `memory-bank/mvp-plan.md` and log completions in `memory-bank/progress.md`.

## Narrative Authoring & Storylets
### Storylet Workflow
1. Define new narrative beats in the locale bundles under `src/content/storylets/{en,uk}.ts`, mirroring the structure in `types.ts`.
2. Register each storylet in `src/content/storylets/index.ts` so the Redux slice can look it up by resource key.
3. Wire mission/quest triggers through `storyletSlice.ts`—queue entries reference the storylet ID, locale keys, and any faction or skill rewards.
4. Add coverage in `src/store/__tests__/storyletSlice.test.ts` (and related selector specs) to lock in trigger logic, queue ordering, and reward application.
5. Run `yarn test --runTestsByPath src/store/__tests__/storyletSlice.test.ts` while iterating so regressions in queue logic surface quickly.

### Scene Generation From Narrative Prompts
Use the narrative triple pipeline when you want a mission prompt to spawn a Phaser-ready layout:

```bash
cd the-getaway
yarn narrative:generate \
  --level levels.slums_command_grid \
  --mission missions.level0.recover_cache \
  --quest quests.market_cache \
  --story "The crew drags salvage carts into the stair-cut alley under the market signal tower, locking it down before the patrol loop returns."
```

- The CLI validates the generated payload, materialises prop placements, and writes JSON to `src/content/levels/<level-id>/missions/<mission-id>/generatedScenes/`.
- Use `--input ./prompt.txt` instead of `--story` to read longer briefs from disk.
- Pass `--dry-run` to preview validation and placement issues without writing files; add `--verbose` to surface triple-validation warnings.
- For manual control, edit the emitted JSON directly or iterate on the mission prompt and rerun the CLI; advanced authors can fork the script to pass explicit triple bundles.

After generation:
1. Register the new scene in `src/content/scenes/generatedScenes.ts` (resource key → definition).
2. Append the scene key to the owning mission via the `generatedSceneKeys` array so gameplay systems can discover it.
3. If placements need tweaking, adjust the JSON manually or rerun the CLI with refined prompts.

### Validating Narrative Assets
- `yarn test --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/narrativeValidation.test.ts` ensures all locale, mission, quest, and storylet references resolve.
- `yarn test --runTestsByPath src/game/world/__tests__/worldGenerationPipeline.test.ts src/game/world/__tests__/relationRules.test.ts` confirms relation rules produce collision-safe placements.
- Keep `memory-bank/architecture.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` updated whenever you introduce new authoring patterns or complete roadmap steps.

## Testing & QA
- Jest suites cover combat maths, dialogue gating, skill allocation, curfew flows, and UI regression (`src/__tests__`).
- `yarn test` for full coverage; target files (e.g., `dialogueOverlay.test.tsx`, `combat.test.ts`) when iterating fast.
- `yarn build` validates TypeScript + bundler health before every commit.
- Manual smoke: roam both districts, trigger curfew, engage patrols, and validate bilingual toggles.

## Roadmap Signal
- **Perk System (Step 24.3)**: Capstone perks and perk-aware combat hooks on deck.
- **Equipment Durability & Encumbrance (Step 25+)**: Extend stat aggregation into movement penalties and maintenance loops.
- **Directional Cover & Overwatch (Step 26+)**: Deepen tactical positioning with flanking, overwatch cones, and targeted shots.
- Track the full 24-step roadmap inside `memory-bank/mvp-plan.md`—Level 0 continues to expand toward full campaign readiness.
