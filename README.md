# The Getaway: Escape from Tyranny

A dystopian tactical RPG set in 2036 America, where players navigate a country under dictatorial rule and attempt to escape northward to freedom in Canada.

## Game Overview

**Setting**: The year is 2036. The United States has fallen under an authoritarian regime led by a dictator who rose to power through demagoguery and media manipulation. You are a 20-year-old of Latin American heritage from Miami, struggling to survive in the oppressive environment.
